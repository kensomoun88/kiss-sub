WEBVTT

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:44.000
DRUG USE ISNâ€™T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:50.250
I don't need billions.
My dream is to have a small place

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.852
to live with my family.

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:54.563
But now, our house is going up for auction!

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:56.667
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:58.125
There's virtually no hope.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:00:59.792
Dad will die without money.

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:02.500
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.411
Where did this come from?

00:01:04.722 --> 00:01:05.999
200 million every month?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.167
James?
He only deals with VIPs.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.000
You're James, aren't you?

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:14.999
Let's be partners.
You and me.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:19.999
The quiet art tutor
turns out to be a drug dealer...

00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:24.669
For me, these are like game chips.

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:27.792
To get me to the real prize.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.918
My gift, brand new.

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:33.895
But with this,
no one gets hurt.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.584
No one forces it.
They do it because they want to.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.709
I'm curious.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.167
What else can the lady give me?

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.840
I hope this doesn't screw me over.

00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:48.751
If you don't find the bag,
it won't end with your brother's finger.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.234
I'll take care of him.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.334
You little pussy!

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:57.542
Run!

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.417
- What? Room 3?
- Room 3?

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.902
Are you sure it's room 3?

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:14.791
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:18.334
This is more than my 3 months'
worth of salary at the store.

00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:20.999
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.127
Kill 'em.

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:24.057
I think I found your drugs.

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:27.999
Don't worry, Sua.
Mommy loves you.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:31.999
MEDICAL REPORT

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.375
It's the 2nd week of Mr. Park's treatment,
and he is experiencing adverse reactions.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.709
The abdominal pain has gotten worse.

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:42.584
As you can see here,
the cancer is spreading too fast.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.917
So, it's gotten worse?

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:48.943
Our priority is to slow down the cancer
and shrink the tumor,

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.959
but looking at the patient's condition,
continuing chemo is out of the question.

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:54.881
Then what else can we do?

00:02:54.904 --> 00:02:57.375
Switching to immunotherapy
would be better.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.377
Immunotherapy?

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.939
Conventional chemo affects healthy cells
and has severe side effects.

00:03:02.978 --> 00:03:07.125
Immunotherapy activates immune cells,
so the side effects are lighter.

00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:11.091
Of course, for pancreatic cancer,
there isn't much solid data,

00:03:11.122 --> 00:03:14.584
but for now it's the only option
for Mr. Park Dojin.

00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:16.352
- I see.
- However...

00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:22.918
Most immunotherapies aren't covered
by domestic health insurance.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.110
How much is it?
Just tell me straight.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.559
Six million won per cycle.

00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:36.052
Ma'am?

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.948
Ah, sorry.

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.836
Mom, the shower's weird!

00:04:19.584 --> 00:04:21.536
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.099
Don't eat side dishes with your hands.

00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.542
Does she have eyes
in the back of her head?

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.071
Mom, should we switch?
To a shower filter?

00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:40.792
Yoojung's family uses it.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.667
Who's Yoojung?

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:44.855
A new girl in the art class.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.433
She was originally Jinhee's friend,
but we got close.

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:48.613
Really?

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:51.191
The art class got
a ton of new members.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.632
Most of them are more interested
in Mr. Lee than in art.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.334
They keep asking
if he has a girlfriend or not.

00:04:59.362 --> 00:05:00.680
So annoying.

00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:10.709
Mom, are you okay?

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:24.083
Fuck...

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.999
EPISODE 3

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.959
Thank you.

00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:13.066
- How's your hand?
- It's... fine.

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:14.999
Show me.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.608
I called the best doctor,
so it should be fine.

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:22.273
You get me, right?
I didn't want to hurt you.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.335
I was caught in the middle myself.

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:27.813
I understand.

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:32.417
Eat.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.292
Eat, Junhyun.

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:36.083
- Thank you for the food.
- Yeah.

00:06:39.276 --> 00:06:41.274
You like this, right?
Have it as well.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.751
Help yourselves.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:46.977
Donghyun, do you want to quit?

00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:49.834
I wish I could let you.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:53.125
You're too good to be stuck here, right?

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:54.590
Remember.

00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:59.575
No matter what,
whatever it takes,

00:06:59.884 --> 00:07:03.016
you have to get it back.
Got it?

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:10.437
- Over here.
- Yes.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.778
The heating system's
water pump has burst.

00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:08.792
What's worse, there's leakage too.
A crack in the water pipes.

00:08:09.049 --> 00:08:12.397
This house is very old
so it'll take a lot to repair.

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:16.867
Even if the leakage is sealed, the
heating system and the pipes need change.

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:22.486
It'll cost about 2 million won.
Somewhere around there.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:28.042
- Is it really necessary?
- Well, I guess not.

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.248
As long as you don't mind washing
in cold, rusty water.

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:03.999
483,000 won...

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:11.834
Everyone buys groceries online,
not offline.

00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:13.506
Even if we promote like this,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:18.182
people will still buy through apps
like Market Kurly or Oaris.

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:21.375
I personally still prefer
buying ingredients in person.

00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:24.002
Well, youngsters these days
are different.

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:26.000
It's the age of
non-face-to-face.

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:28.125
Dating, business,
time with friends...

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:32.000
It's all done on the phone.
What makes groceries different?

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.751
Eunsoo!

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:40.125
Oh...
Hi, there.

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:42.876
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:44.999
Tell me about it.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:48.511
He's been busier than a professor
as a mid-level manager!

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:50.876
I'm a department head.

00:09:51.877 --> 00:09:53.393
Whatever, same thing.

00:09:53.455 --> 00:09:56.041
Why do they send you
on so many business trips?

00:09:57.584 --> 00:10:00.416
Why'd you put that in?
It's not organic.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.013
And about that...

00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:12.747
This place barely has any organic produce.
Make a separate section for it.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.125
I usually go to the organic store
by the station.

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:18.999
I only come here because of you.

00:10:19.774 --> 00:10:21.542
- I'll suggest it.
- Great.

00:10:21.584 --> 00:10:23.999
I knew you'd understand me.

00:10:24.654 --> 00:10:25.944
I'll leave you to it then.

00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:31.921
Sorry about that.

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:40.999

KANG EUNSOO
PHANTOM

00:11:08.702 --> 00:11:10.310
Partnership contract.

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:13.334
This contract is between
James and Kang Eunsoo...

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:15.500
KANG HWIRIM

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:18.973
...for the purpose of supplying
and selling meth...

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:19.716
Yeah.

00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:22.583
We're going to my villa this weekend.
Wanna come?

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:24.372
Why not?

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:26.792
I don't invite just
anyone to my villa.

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:28.912
You'll bring it, right?

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:33.292
- The new one from Saturday.
- Maybe.

00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:35.697
I'll pay you well, so bring plenty.

00:11:35.697 --> 00:11:35.713
I'll pay you well, so bring plenty.
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friends.

00:11:35.713 --> 00:11:37.500
Don't embarrass me
in front of my friends.

00:11:38.158 --> 00:11:39.668
I never forget stuff like that.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.667
One. Kang Eunsoo agrees
to supply meth to James...

00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:53.982
- Your grandfather's here, focus.
- Sorry, it was work.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.227
Oh? Father!

00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.918
Father! Father!

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:02.999
The kids are so beautiful.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.999
You did so well.

00:12:14.999 --> 00:12:16.626
Well done!

00:12:21.959 --> 00:12:26.115
Three. If Kang Eunsoo
fails to uphold Section 2

00:12:26.123 --> 00:12:29.552
or is responsible for
causing damage to James,

00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:31.709
Kang Eunsoo must compensate.

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:34.334
Four. If any problem arises

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:38.667
due to the source of the product,
Kang Eunsoo must take full responsibility.

00:13:03.255 --> 00:13:04.797
You're leaving now?

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:07.542
Poor thing.

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:12.404
I told you to wait
until the heating's fixed.

00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:15.408
Why would you wash your hair
with cold water?

00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:17.736
How can I not?
Impossible.

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:20.999
Oh my!

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.375
Hey, wait a second.
Stay here.

00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:36.292
Where's that black padded jacket
from last year?

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:38.860
Gosh...

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:54.762
I wore this in primary school.

00:13:54.778 --> 00:13:59.009
It still fits because
it was oversized. It's pretty.

00:13:59.042 --> 00:14:02.696
This is goose down, okay?
Real feathers.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.209
Better than freezing, right?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.375
I'll get the boiler fixed quickly.

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:13.083
I love you, honey.
Come straight home after school.

00:14:13.848 --> 00:14:16.999
Love you too.
I'll be off then.

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:42.083
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo,
due to your continued missed payments

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:44.999
and avoidance of contact,
legal action will be taken.

00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:50.292
ART CLASS TUTOR

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:56.042
The number you have dialed
is switched off.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.294
Are you kidding me?

00:15:23.254 --> 00:15:26.124
- Can you tell who's who?
- Sorry, sir.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.334
What about the VIP floor?

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:32.281
The footage got wiped,
and we're still recovering it.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.626
- Show the day before.
- The entire month got erased.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.542
I'll report it
when it's all recovered.

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:38.959
Hey, play it.

00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:39.959
Take a look at this.

00:15:44.872 --> 00:15:47.858
That day at Medusa,
there was an influencer's birthday party.

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:51.742
That girl Mimi - her family runs
a foreign company,

00:15:51.758 --> 00:15:54.733
and has her own fashion brand.
She's an Instagram celebrity.

00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:55.999
Just get to the point.

00:15:56.459 --> 00:16:00.195
As you can see, the birthday party
was open to the public,

00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:02.209
and took place on the main stage
of basement 2.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.230
However, she hung out separately
with her friends on the VIP floor above.

00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:09.792
So basically, she spent around
two hours on the VIP floor

00:16:09.834 --> 00:16:11.999
before she came down to dance.

00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:15.396
I guess those two hours
were the highlight.

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:18.601
I believe so,
but we have no proof.

00:16:18.616 --> 00:16:20.952
We haven't ID'd the others yet,
but over there...

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.083
That's the grandson of
TwoN Group's Chairman, Kang Goonam.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:30.042
His name is Kang Hwirim,
either a boyfriend or sponsor of Mimi.

00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:31.485
Pause.

00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:33.989
Who's that? The tall guy.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:36.042
No idea.
Maybe a club official?

00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:37.622
He only appeared here.

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:43.213
Hmm...

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:53.042
I don't think so.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:00.959
You took your whole crew
and filmed a movie.

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:04.163
But you let the drug dealer
and buyers get away.

00:17:04.218 --> 00:17:06.999
And the only guy you caught
is refusing to testify.

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.458
Did I get the situation right?

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:12.999
Hey!

00:17:13.844 --> 00:17:15.034
What's wrong with you?

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.751
You're our best guy.
What's going on?

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:29.500
The Organized Crime Division
has taken an interest.

00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:30.660
What?

00:17:30.707 --> 00:17:33.209
Taegu, you have to produce results.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.626
If this collapses, your chances
of promotion will become zero.

00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:48.292
Hey!

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:51.718
It's twice a month.
Twice, you hear?

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:54.417
You're violating visitation rights.

00:17:54.537 --> 00:17:56.083
You want your custody revoked?

00:17:56.216 --> 00:17:58.292
Don't use Mingyo as an excuse!

00:17:58.334 --> 00:18:03.584
What did you say to him
to make him refuse to see me?

00:18:04.323 --> 00:18:05.905
Hey... Hey!

00:18:18.198 --> 00:18:19.782
Was that your wife?

00:18:22.223 --> 00:18:24.959
We divorced ages ago.
She's not my wife.

00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:29.189
Don't worry, we're keeping
the club under surveillance.

00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:32.918
Are you dumb?
All the clubs know about our raid.

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:36.600
They'll be hiding for months,
and won't even violate traffic laws.

00:18:40.565 --> 00:18:43.398
Where did you say
Kim Minwoo is right now?

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.042
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

00:18:48.118 --> 00:18:50.278
It's been days.

00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:53.417
He's got a fever and
was in pain all night.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:57.141
Do something.
Give him painkillers at least.

00:18:57.141 --> 00:18:57.149
Do something.
Give him painkillers at least.
We've already given the maximum.
Let's wait and see...

00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:59.664
We've already given the maximum.
Let's wait and see...

00:18:59.664 --> 00:19:02.334
How long must we wait?
He's about to die!

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:04.999
You're making it worse.
Just let me be.

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:06.031
Still...

00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:22.999
Looking at the patient's condition,
continuing chemo is out of the question.

00:19:24.334 --> 00:19:25.921
Then what else can we do?

00:19:25.929 --> 00:19:28.500
Switching to immunotherapy
would be better.

00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:47.999
No, it's okay.

00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:51.600
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes.

00:19:55.959 --> 00:19:57.931
Shouldn't you be at work?
How did you get here?

00:19:57.955 --> 00:19:59.876
I just popped in during lunch.

00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:04.125
Eunsoo, take this.

00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:08.693
What is this?

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.375
You love my anchovies.
It's for you.

00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:13.999
Thanks.

00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:18.375
It felt empty after you left.

00:20:19.368 --> 00:20:23.071
But with Dojin also gone,
work's not fun at all.

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:26.481
I didn't quit.
I got fired.

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:30.895
Are you alright?
How do you feel?

00:20:30.942 --> 00:20:34.215
I feel a bit better.
Less nauseous.

00:20:34.754 --> 00:20:38.167
Really?
Hey, it's because I came.

00:20:40.042 --> 00:20:42.334
You know, right?
The Yeoju effect.

00:20:42.906 --> 00:20:44.746
They say laughing is the best.

00:20:44.769 --> 00:20:46.709
Call me anytime, boss.

00:20:46.999 --> 00:20:48.876
Yeah, I think it's working.

00:20:57.374 --> 00:21:00.876
I bought it at the clinic my mom goes to.
For you and Sua.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.167
Thanks for getting one
for Sua too.

00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:08.417
You first!
Take care of yourself first.

00:21:08.459 --> 00:21:12.083
Dojin and Sua have you.
But who's taking care of you?

00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:16.252
You have to eat well
and pace yourself carefully.

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.727
Don't suddenly snap
and do something reckless.

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:22.792
What would I do?

00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:26.733
People like you are the scariest.

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:28.576
Don't you remember school?

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:31.338
You threw flip-flops at that teacher
in front of everyone.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.250
That was...

00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:40.999
I get it. He harassed us
whenever he could for being poor.

00:21:46.692 --> 00:21:47.999
Hey, Kang Eunsoo!

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:51.999
You went from being called
the best student to a psycho.

00:21:52.317 --> 00:21:54.500
Don't mess with
the psycho Eunsoo!

00:21:57.999 --> 00:21:59.542
I remember it like yesterday.

00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:01.792
Baek Yeoju,
get back to your seat.

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:03.144
Sit down, chop-chop.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.500
You were really different.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:14.053
Our backgrounds were similar,
but you were confident, as if...

00:22:14.736 --> 00:22:16.153
As if you had everything.

00:22:17.195 --> 00:22:19.194
Maybe that's why
we're still so different.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.999
Anyway, don't let your stress pile up.

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:30.626
If it piles up too much,
you won't be able to handle it.

00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:37.959
So don't bottle it up.
Let it out once in a while.

00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:42.500
Either to me or to your husband.

00:22:48.017 --> 00:22:48.834
Yeoju.

00:22:52.584 --> 00:22:54.250
Well, actually...

00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:57.792
What I mean is...

00:23:05.999 --> 00:23:09.459
I'll pay you back,
no matter what.

00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:13.371
Hey, it's fine.
It wasn't that much.

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:19.082
Pay me back by getting
Dojin completely healed.

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:56.295
How's the food?
Does it suit your taste?

00:23:56.326 --> 00:24:00.411
Talk to my lawyer.
I've got nothing to say.

00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:05.864
Kim Minwoo, born 1993.

00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:09.861
Father's name, Kim Seochil.
Former CEO of Hansu Heavy Industries.

00:24:09.877 --> 00:24:14.789
Once owned a few buildings in Gwangnam,
but the business went bankrupt.

00:24:14.852 --> 00:24:17.266
Everything gets sold
and he's been broke for a while.

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:22.574
You're father is currently
an acting-executive of a bar in Daegu,

00:24:22.598 --> 00:24:26.888
while his son continues
to enjoy chaebol cosplay.

00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:29.334
Who the hell are you?

00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:34.226
You paid a 200 million won deposit
to get into Medusa's VIP floor.

00:24:35.597 --> 00:24:37.094
Loan shark?

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:43.542
It's obvious how you're
affording this private room.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.354
You'd rather die
than bend your pride.

00:24:46.378 --> 00:24:48.558
Class lasts forever, is that it?

00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:54.209
Are you a stalker?
Isn't this illegal?

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.350
Does your loan shark
know that you're completely broke?

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:02.685
I might as well tell them.

00:25:12.434 --> 00:25:13.999
I have no interest in you.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.682
All I need to know is the guy

00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:20.784
who brought the drugs.

00:25:22.896 --> 00:25:29.936
But if you keep your mouth shut
and refuse to cooperate like this,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.167
then I might start taking
an interest in other things.

00:25:38.448 --> 00:25:39.406
What will it be?

00:25:49.831 --> 00:25:51.876
Do you really want my attention?

00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:03.709
James... James...

00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:06.756
How did you find all that out?

00:26:06.764 --> 00:26:11.083
State authority exists
for times like these.

00:26:12.526 --> 00:26:14.355
What time did you say
Medusa opens?

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:18.955
It opens on Fridays and Saturdays
from 9 pm to 10 am.

00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:21.709
- Call and double-check.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:50.417 --> 00:26:54.064
Sua, your cold seems bad.
Want to leave early?

00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:56.250
No! I'm fine.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.787
She'll skip other classes,
but never art.

00:26:59.787 --> 00:26:59.792
She'll skip other classes,
but never art.
- Right, Sua?
- I just like this class.

00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:02.766
- Right, Sua?
- I just like this class.

00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:04.999
So you don't like me?

00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:08.880
No, I did not mean it like that.

00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:10.660
Then why's your face red?

00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:12.959
- What are you talking about?
- It's red!

00:27:16.792 --> 00:27:20.334
- Wipe your nose.
- Thanks.

00:27:23.378 --> 00:27:24.293
Not there.

00:27:26.771 --> 00:27:28.238
- Done.
- Done?

00:27:29.358 --> 00:27:30.932
- Mr. Lee!
- Yes?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.752
Want to see Sua's sketchbook?

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:34.885
- There are drawings of...
- Yoojung, stop.

00:27:34.885 --> 00:27:34.893
- There are drawings of...
- Yoojung, stop.
- Hey, no!
- Just once!

00:27:34.893 --> 00:27:36.292
- Hey, no!
- Just once!

00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:39.459
No, don't. I'm serious!

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.417
Sua, there's a hole in your jacket.

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:44.999
- Where?
- Here.

00:27:46.837 --> 00:27:49.979
Oh, she's right.
Sua, there's a hole in your sleeve.

00:27:54.908 --> 00:27:56.626
Where? I don't see it.

00:27:56.626 --> 00:28:00.295
Look, on the left sleeve.
There's a big hole...

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:07.577
Yoojung, go take your seat.

00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:54.918
NEAR-EXPIRATION PRODUCTS

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:02.971
Have a good day.

00:29:04.872 --> 00:29:08.825
- Eunsoo.
- Hey, going to give a lecture?

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:10.344
Yeah, afternoon lecture.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.649
- Oh, take this.
- What is it?

00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:18.209
Get your girl a decent winter coat.

00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:21.250
NEAR-EXPIRATION PRODUCTS

00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:24.334
Good grief...

00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:28.214
Wait!
Stop for a second!

00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:10.950
Damn it!

00:30:27.416 --> 00:30:29.332
You didn't have to carry it.

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:32.709
You even gave me a lift.
Thank you.

00:30:32.751 --> 00:30:36.000
It's fine, I was on my way
to make a delivery.

00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:40.999
- Where should I put this?
- Oh, over there. On top.

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:42.584
Thank you.

00:30:43.334 --> 00:30:44.706
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:30:44.722 --> 00:30:48.792
- Want some juice?
- No, water's fine.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.751
Just a moment.

00:31:00.344 --> 00:31:01.344
Thank you.

00:31:09.709 --> 00:31:12.834
Um, could I wash my hands?

00:31:12.876 --> 00:31:15.167
Just wash here.
Come.

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:21.241
Oh my!

00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:27.459
As you can see,
the house is a bit old.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:33.417
Actually, we're replacing
the pipes tomorrow.

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:35.252
Oh, I see.

00:31:36.375 --> 00:31:39.463
Sorry your hand got dirtier.

00:31:40.584 --> 00:31:44.779
- Want to rinse it with this water?
- No.

00:31:44.818 --> 00:31:47.667
Actually, if you don't mind...

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.542
You know how to do that?

00:32:25.584 --> 00:32:29.391
Yeah, I used to do
pipe-cleaning as part-time.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.743
I learned it then.

00:32:31.758 --> 00:32:35.246
By the way, I heard you got
into Seonjoong Construction.

00:32:36.542 --> 00:32:39.999
Congrats!
That's a big company, right?

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:43.500
Well, it's not finalized yet.

00:32:43.542 --> 00:32:45.918
There's a third interview left.

00:32:46.147 --> 00:32:48.459
But it's my first time making it this far.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.250
- So you'll soon switch jobs?
- Yeah, probably.

00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:56.846
I'll have to quit
everything I used to do.

00:32:57.677 --> 00:32:59.122
That doesn't sound easy.

00:32:59.771 --> 00:33:04.417
The boss is really fond of you.
You're quiet and good at the job.

00:33:04.834 --> 00:33:06.584
She won't let you go easily.

00:33:23.083 --> 00:33:24.999
Don't mind me.

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:30.247
No, it's fine.
It's all clean now.

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:34.999
It's temporary, so rusty water
might flow out again.

00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:38.293
Still, it should be fine for a while.

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:40.703
How can I repay you?

00:33:40.742 --> 00:33:45.367
How about some side dishes?
You live with a younger sibling, right?

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:49.293
No, really.
You don't have to.

00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:55.709
You can't eat out every day.

00:33:55.751 --> 00:33:58.696
You need to eat well
before your interview.

00:33:58.696 --> 00:33:58.709
You need to eat well
before your interview.
I'll pack you some soup too.
Do you like pollock soup?

00:33:58.709 --> 00:34:01.944
I'll pack you some soup too.
Do you like pollock soup?

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:07.281
Yes, I do. Thank you.

00:34:10.209 --> 00:34:17.089
Listen, could you drop me off
at the subway station on your way?

00:34:17.093 --> 00:34:18.385
Ah, sure.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.334
The number you have dialed
is switched off...

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:32.000
DELIVERY MAN

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.711
Sua.

00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.928
- Heading home?
- Yes.

00:35:00.047 --> 00:35:01.566
Welcome.

00:35:05.167 --> 00:35:09.209
Could you pick a padded jacket
for my girl at this price?

00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:21.999
You really didn't have to
give me a ride.

00:35:24.085 --> 00:35:26.167
I'm going in the same direction anyway.

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:46.332
You got a feather there.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.999
- How are things going?
- Pardon?

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:09.785
I heard your father's sick.
Cancer, right?

00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:13.876
How did you know?

00:36:15.334 --> 00:36:17.999
I just heard the girls talking.

00:36:19.667 --> 00:36:21.042
Am I being too nosy?

00:36:22.692 --> 00:36:25.198
My homeroom teacher
and friends all know.

00:36:25.887 --> 00:36:26.959
It's pancreatic cancer.

00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:30.659
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:33.627
It must be hard for you.

00:36:34.999 --> 00:36:37.876
No, not as much as my mom.

00:36:38.334 --> 00:36:41.154
Caring for Dad, working,
and looking after me too.

00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:43.667
She never shows it though.

00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:46.574
She didn't even cry
when Dad got cancer.

00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:50.832
Actually, I've never seen her cry.

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.769
Maybe she cries alone.

00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:55.375
That's even lonelier.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.918
Crying is worse
when you're alone.

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:01.461
Are all grown-ups like that?

00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:04.577
Are you like that too?
Do you cry alone?

00:37:12.927 --> 00:37:15.000
Mr. Lee, it's this way.

00:37:15.042 --> 00:37:16.000
Yeah.

00:37:27.602 --> 00:37:28.999
Thank you.

00:37:30.823 --> 00:37:31.781
Is that...

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:36.500
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Lee.
You made my day.

00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:38.223
Don't worry about it.

00:37:38.292 --> 00:37:39.250
God!

00:37:44.768 --> 00:37:46.604
Why are you getting out of his car?

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:48.000
What do you mean?

00:37:48.042 --> 00:37:50.375
He's my art tutor, remember?

00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:52.876
Hello, ma'am.
Nice to see you again.

00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:55.673
He gave me a ride
because I caught a cold.

00:37:56.417 --> 00:37:59.999
Thanks, but please
don't do this again.

00:38:00.596 --> 00:38:01.928
Let's go inside, hurry.

00:38:02.597 --> 00:38:04.055
See you at school!

00:38:05.292 --> 00:38:06.250
Bye.

00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:21.999
32 HAENGBOK-RO, 55

00:38:23.667 --> 00:38:26.125
DESIGNATED REDEVELOPMENT ZONE

00:38:28.042 --> 00:38:30.160
Where did you lose
the drug bag again?

00:38:30.254 --> 00:38:32.751
Haengbok-dong redevelopment zone.

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:56.753
Yeah, I checked the samples.

00:38:57.804 --> 00:38:59.999
I think we found your stash.

00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:04.537
What's this?

00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:07.732
Try it on.

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:16.500
How is it? Do I look good?

00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:19.829
Of course.
You look great.

00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:21.250
So pretty.

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:24.466
Jinhee has one too.
Mine's prettier though.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.999
I'm surprised.
You actually bought this?

00:39:28.042 --> 00:39:29.751
Wasn't it expensive?

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.999
No, it was on sale.
Didn't cost much.

00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:36.999
That's a relief.

00:39:48.473 --> 00:39:53.000
Sua, don't hop into strangers' cars.

00:39:53.855 --> 00:39:56.000
How is my art tutor a stranger?

00:39:56.523 --> 00:40:00.828
He's still an adult man.
You're a minor.

00:40:00.843 --> 00:40:03.500
He's not a criminal.
Don't worry.

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:12.190
Do you want to go
to an art academy instead?

00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:14.751
Extracurricular art class is good.

00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:17.999
But an art academy
will prep you better for Uni.

00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:21.500
Art class is only three times a week.

00:40:21.542 --> 00:40:22.626
Besides...

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.820
Why are you looking like that?

00:40:27.806 --> 00:40:29.000
What about the fee?

00:40:30.292 --> 00:40:31.250
Huh?

00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:36.770
An art academy costs three times more.
Can we afford money?

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:25.125
What's this?

00:41:25.167 --> 00:41:28.754
Buy her some nice winter clothes.

00:41:28.777 --> 00:41:29.999
Do you have the money?

00:42:23.495 --> 00:42:25.952
Gosh, unbelievable.

00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:29.125
You looked at me like
I was a germ.

00:42:29.167 --> 00:42:33.500
Sorry, I was just surprised earlier.

00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:35.999
I'm tired,
just get to the point.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.535
When will you start selling again?

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:44.125
You said you needed more, right?

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:47.441
But I haven't heard from you.

00:42:47.457 --> 00:42:49.125
When are you selling again?

00:42:50.761 --> 00:42:52.375
Didn't I tell you?

00:42:52.858 --> 00:42:55.109
We can't operate at Medusa for now.

00:42:55.234 --> 00:42:57.398
That district is crawling with cops.

00:42:57.437 --> 00:43:00.626
Really?
For how long?

00:43:01.292 --> 00:43:03.610
Could be a month.
Maybe two.

00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:06.500
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:08.151
Why are you asking me?

00:43:08.182 --> 00:43:10.846
It was your role to promote
and bring in customers.

00:43:10.862 --> 00:43:12.745
We've got ten kilos of product.
If we can't sell,

00:43:12.745 --> 00:43:14.125
what's the point of this partnership?

00:43:14.167 --> 00:43:16.751
Why aren't you working?
Isn't this a breach of contract?

00:43:22.436 --> 00:43:26.000
Mrs. Kang, did you say ten kilos?
Not one?

00:43:26.744 --> 00:43:29.250
I knew something was wrong.

00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:32.626
Turns out it was trouble after all, eh?

00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:39.999
What do you mean by that?
What trouble?

00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:49.000
Are we really giving James
ten percent?

00:43:49.852 --> 00:43:52.125
Will you actually pay him
for bringing the stuff?

00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:53.999
Ten percent is hundreds of millions.

00:43:54.292 --> 00:43:56.626
Junhyun, aren't you curious?

00:43:56.658 --> 00:43:57.872
About what?

00:43:57.888 --> 00:43:59.999
What he looks like.

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:02.876
It's been two years,
yet we still don't know his face.

00:44:20.844 --> 00:44:23.500
Aren't you coming in?
Then wait there.

00:45:06.918 --> 00:45:09.250
PHANTOM
KANG EUNSOO

00:45:11.356 --> 00:45:12.999
Explain this.

00:45:12.999 --> 00:45:16.500
How is your stuff identical
to Phantom's new drug?

00:45:18.776 --> 00:45:19.858
Head's up, lady.

00:45:20.542 --> 00:45:23.125
Phantom is my supplier.

00:45:23.167 --> 00:45:26.500
The drugs you stole
included my shipment too.

00:45:31.713 --> 00:45:33.238
Honestly, I was surprised.

00:45:33.779 --> 00:45:36.000
How does a civilian steal from pros?

00:45:36.388 --> 00:45:37.947
And for what?

00:45:38.017 --> 00:45:40.572
You're not the only one
who'll get screwed here!

00:45:40.603 --> 00:45:43.000
Even the cops are after this stuff!

00:45:43.042 --> 00:45:45.369
Are you trying to ruin my life?

00:45:48.056 --> 00:45:50.013
I didn't mean any harm.

00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:53.125
Do you know
how I survived in this industry?

00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.653
I never take risks.

00:45:56.677 --> 00:45:58.751
Not for customers nor myself.

00:45:58.792 --> 00:46:01.122
It's easy to get carried away
in this line of work.

00:46:01.144 --> 00:46:02.856
By drugs or money.

00:46:02.864 --> 00:46:03.999
And then you get careless.

00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:06.172
You start spilling info
and leaving traces.

00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:08.797
That's how you get caught.
Or killed.

00:46:08.813 --> 00:46:12.250
But me?
I never get carried away.

00:46:12.539 --> 00:46:16.022
Because I mustn't.
I can't afford to!

00:46:16.038 --> 00:46:20.000
Then you came along
and broke the rules, you hear?

00:46:24.417 --> 00:46:27.260
Wait, who are you calling?

00:46:27.268 --> 00:46:30.751
Who else? The owner of the drugs.
I'm not taking the fall.

00:46:30.792 --> 00:46:34.901
No, please. Have mercy...

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.250
Are you crazy?

00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:39.625
What?

00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:43.250
Hello?

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.719
What the hell?

00:47:04.999 --> 00:47:08.000
Hey, do you really want to die?

00:47:12.167 --> 00:47:17.000
Please, just give me
one more chance!

00:47:17.042 --> 00:47:19.500
I'll do anything.

00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:23.250
I'll do whatever you say.

00:47:24.167 --> 00:47:28.683
Please, for my family's sake.
Just this once.

00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:31.375
For Sua's sake, I beg you.

00:47:31.417 --> 00:47:33.000
Please.

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.118
You'll really do anything?

00:47:37.251 --> 00:47:39.312
Yes, anything.

00:47:39.351 --> 00:47:41.626
Then hand everything over.

00:47:42.042 --> 00:47:43.876
The whole stolen bag.

00:47:49.761 --> 00:47:53.610
Business is already down
because of police raids.

00:47:55.245 --> 00:47:56.795
Are you really going to do this?

00:47:56.826 --> 00:47:59.125
Then just bring me James.

00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:01.194
He's the biggest shot
around here, right?

00:48:01.225 --> 00:48:04.626
He buys new cars all the time,
and deals only with VIPs.

00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:06.000
Let me meet him.

00:48:06.042 --> 00:48:09.189
In a way, I'm a VIP too.

00:48:09.213 --> 00:48:11.439
I don't know such a person!

00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:12.713
You're so frustrating.

00:48:12.728 --> 00:48:17.000
Check the employment list.
There's no James in there!

00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:27.375
If you do that,
I'll at least spare your life.

00:48:27.417 --> 00:48:32.727
But without that drug,
our family will...

00:48:32.735 --> 00:48:33.999
Damn it!

00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:38.375
You said it's none
of my business, remember?

00:48:55.818 --> 00:48:58.859
Fuck, I forgot the number...

00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:18.500
3, 2...

00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:21.751
There's another way to sell it.

00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:24.250
What?

00:49:28.042 --> 00:49:31.000
People like you,
the younger generation.

00:49:31.042 --> 00:49:32.896
Friends, romance, money...

00:49:32.927 --> 00:49:34.755
Everyone does everything

00:49:34.786 --> 00:49:36.375
using their phones.

00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:40.876
Can't we sell drugs that way too?

00:49:46.274 --> 00:49:48.999
If cutting risk is your rule,

00:49:48.999 --> 00:49:50.692
online is the safest.

00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:53.348
There are too many variables
with trades like this.

00:49:53.371 --> 00:49:55.125
Remember Medusa?

00:49:55.167 --> 00:49:56.375
That pussy...

00:49:56.871 --> 00:50:02.156
When that man screwed up.
If I hadn't switched the room signs,

00:50:02.187 --> 00:50:04.687
you and your customers
would've been arrested.

00:50:05.195 --> 00:50:07.508
Don't get full of yourself.

00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:09.000
Do you think I'm that sloppy?

00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:11.999
You would've left a trace
or spilled some info.

00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:16.999
I'll handle customer ops and delivery.

00:50:16.999 --> 00:50:19.000
Everything will be
non-face-to-face.

00:50:19.042 --> 00:50:23.999
Customers won't know who we are.
Certainly not you.

00:50:24.916 --> 00:50:27.744
Think about it.
The police are watching the clubs.

00:50:27.744 --> 00:50:27.752
Think about it.
The police are watching the clubs.
You said so yourself
that we need to find a new venue.

00:50:27.752 --> 00:50:30.955
You said so yourself
that we need to find a new venue.

00:50:30.955 --> 00:50:32.751
It's everywhere.

00:50:34.484 --> 00:50:36.258
You think I don't know that?

00:50:36.273 --> 00:50:37.547
Hear me out.

00:50:37.562 --> 00:50:40.156
When a bank markets itself,
it touts one thing.

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:41.031
Interest rates.

00:50:41.093 --> 00:50:45.870
If people hear your interests
are even 0.001% better,

00:50:45.878 --> 00:50:48.375
even picky customers will switch.

00:50:48.597 --> 00:50:51.972
Same for us.
We can sell below the market price.

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.448
How? Because we don't
have an upfront investment.

00:50:54.488 --> 00:50:57.319
High purity at a low price?
Word spreads fast.

00:50:57.343 --> 00:50:58.952
People will flock from all over.

00:50:58.975 --> 00:51:01.530
Selling in clubs
won't even be comparable.

00:51:01.561 --> 00:51:03.725
Ten kilos?
I can sell that quickly.

00:51:03.803 --> 00:51:06.147
Before the police
or Phantom even notice.

00:51:11.448 --> 00:51:13.604
We can earn at least
eight to ten billion won.

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:16.448
Why give it up to the Phantom
when we can have it for ourselves?

00:51:16.487 --> 00:51:18.432
Because of risks
that haven't even happened?

00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:50.625
You said Kim Minwoo acted
on his own accord.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.000
As for James,
you keep no record?

00:51:54.394 --> 00:51:56.339
Which is better, boss?

00:51:56.355 --> 00:51:57.480
A tax audit?

00:51:58.089 --> 00:51:59.297
Or maybe...

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:06.749
Influencer Mimi,
W-Ent's only daughter Woo Sujin,

00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:13.186
Sungdae Law Firm's Han Seonjae,
and TwoN Group's Kang Hwirim.

00:52:14.201 --> 00:52:17.375
They'll bring in a lot of views, eh?

00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:21.939
I know they had
a drug party here, okay?

00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:25.375
What'll it be?
Do you want to shut down?

00:52:30.795 --> 00:52:31.796
Nice picture.

00:52:33.999 --> 00:52:35.999
RESUME

00:52:35.999 --> 00:52:38.999
KANG EUNSOO

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:51.125
Your plan will be profitable
with low risk in the long run.

00:52:51.606 --> 00:52:52.551
Of course.

00:52:52.574 --> 00:52:55.703
But then again,
you missed something.

00:52:57.049 --> 00:53:01.382
Value - the product's value.

00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:05.242
Making money is important.

00:53:05.323 --> 00:53:07.905
But who I make it from
matters more to me.

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:12.734
Do you think my clients
would take just any drugs sold online?

00:53:13.034 --> 00:53:16.748
Even luxury goods lose value
when sold in a shabby place.

00:53:17.285 --> 00:53:20.125
Please, you must reconsider.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:23.335
I'll do the dirty work, so...

00:53:23.335 --> 00:53:25.952
I really hate repeating myself.

00:53:26.564 --> 00:53:28.147
You remember our contract, right?

00:53:28.322 --> 00:53:31.656
If issues arise due to the source
of the product, who's responsible?

00:53:33.307 --> 00:53:36.390
You're the one responsible,
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.273
21,660 won.

00:53:50.283 --> 00:53:51.492
Here you go.

00:53:56.792 --> 00:53:58.000
Thank you.

00:54:16.787 --> 00:54:19.664
It's over.
There's no other way.

00:54:24.588 --> 00:54:26.171
What's left for me now is...

00:54:29.229 --> 00:54:30.187
Eunsoo.

00:54:31.362 --> 00:54:34.195
Wake up.
Did you sort the returned inventory?

00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:06.171
Bring me the drug bag
by 6 pm tomorrow.

00:55:06.226 --> 00:55:09.960
Then I promise I'll forget
you stole it.

00:55:13.713 --> 00:55:17.541
In three hours,
all hope will be gone.

00:55:18.385 --> 00:55:24.719
I finally understood how
my husband felt on the roof's edge.

00:55:31.808 --> 00:55:37.889
Of what it feels like
to really want to die.

00:57:11.565 --> 00:57:15.773
Friday, Gwangjin Station,
6:30 pm, bench 5-4.

00:57:40.226 --> 00:57:43.175
- What are you doing?
- Mom, this man is smelly.

00:57:43.292 --> 00:57:44.762
Don't say stuff like that.

00:57:45.518 --> 00:57:47.602
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:57:49.307 --> 00:57:51.745
Seriously, he smells like candy.

00:57:51.753 --> 00:57:53.570
It must be your own scent.

00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:14.375
MEDUSA

00:58:15.042 --> 00:58:17.656
- Yeah.
- Where are you, James?

00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:19.375
- Why?
- Come on.

00:58:19.417 --> 00:58:21.250
I haven't seen you lately.

00:58:21.292 --> 00:58:23.860
The train is arriving.

00:58:23.875 --> 00:58:25.000
What? I can't hear.

00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:26.125
I'm busy, call me later.

00:58:26.167 --> 00:58:29.354
Hey, don't hang up!

00:58:30.225 --> 00:58:37.444
Many customers want you.
They're asking for you.

00:58:37.561 --> 00:58:39.721
So where you at, James?

00:58:39.767 --> 00:58:43.080
You said to lie low
for a month or two.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:49.626
Too bad we won't be
seeing each other again.

00:58:50.073 --> 00:58:51.333
Adios, bastard.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.216
What?

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.490
Hey, James!
Don't hang up!

00:59:06.811 --> 00:59:08.688
We got him.
Gwangjin Station!

00:59:37.888 --> 00:59:40.404
Our boss won't be happy
with just the drug bag.

00:59:40.592 --> 00:59:42.125
He'll want the culprit too.

00:59:42.272 --> 00:59:43.999
But James didn't steal it.

00:59:44.542 --> 00:59:47.626
So what?
We just need results.

00:59:48.908 --> 00:59:51.545
Whatever the case,
he has our bag right now.

00:59:51.806 --> 00:59:52.876
Then...

00:59:53.283 --> 00:59:54.241
You see,

00:59:57.698 --> 00:59:59.656
I never liked that guy.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.469
Even his voice.

01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:27.250
Stop right there!

01:00:31.565 --> 01:00:32.524
Hey!

01:00:47.307 --> 01:00:48.265
Heads up.

01:01:03.792 --> 01:01:04.751
Grab him!

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.500
Catch that guy!

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:24.333
I'm going to kill you.

01:02:51.951 --> 01:02:53.250
Ah, damn it!

01:02:55.874 --> 01:02:57.125
What the hell, man!

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.109
Fuck.
Hey, punk!

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:04.375
You owe us an apology,
don't you think?

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:06.412
What is he doing?

01:03:11.951 --> 01:03:13.202
What's wrong with him?

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:22.481
That crazy bitch!

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:01.712
But then again.

01:04:04.013 --> 01:04:07.876
A cornered rat will bite even a cat.

01:04:17.385 --> 01:04:20.218
You know, I just can't
hand you the drugs.

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:23.991
If you don't change your mind,
there's nothing we can do.

01:04:24.842 --> 01:04:27.842
Let's just die together, Mr. Lee.

01:04:35.526 --> 01:04:36.984
Fuck.

01:04:40.594 --> 01:04:42.375
You should at least apologize...

01:04:56.999 --> 01:05:00.000
THREE HOURS EARLIER

01:05:07.479 --> 01:05:11.062
VAKA PEPPERMINT CANDY

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:33.876
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:06:33.983 --> 01:06:35.225
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.420
Your pathetic family hardships!

01:06:37.788 --> 01:06:39.634
They're very common on the streets.

01:06:39.697 --> 01:06:41.869
Watch your tone, little brat.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:43.250
So what now?

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:47.919
Whatever you do,
keep our family out of it.

01:06:48.573 --> 01:06:49.762
Mom, what are you doing?

01:06:49.818 --> 01:06:52.263
Trying to die with that woman,
like she said.

01:06:52.286 --> 01:06:54.999
In one and a half months,
that'll be exactly 200 million won.

01:06:55.419 --> 01:06:56.216
It matches our product.

01:06:56.216 --> 01:06:57.934
I told you no face-to-face deals!

01:06:57.934 --> 01:06:57.942
I told you no face-to-face deals!
I want to make sure
nobody can mess with me again.

01:06:57.942 --> 01:07:03.375
I want to make sure
nobody can mess with me again.
