WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.999
DRUG USE ISN'T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.432
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.240
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:49.959
KOREAN AIRPORT CUSTOMS

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:01.147
Drugs in Korea?

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:04.159
It used to be hard
to bring them in or to sell them.

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.132
Delivery!

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.857
Why?

00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:08.952
Firstly,

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:13.959
people in this country
are super sensitive about morality.

00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:22.890
Secondly, Korean customs
and the police do their job well.

00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:38.042
Finally!

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:39.083
Come out!

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:42.998
You won't come out?
Fine then.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.375
Don't come out.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.334
No, you don't!

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.999
- Fuck you!
- Hey, move aside!

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.626
90% of them get caught and fail.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:15.667
Bingo.

00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:23.396
But there's always that lucky 10%.

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:34.999
High risk, high return.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.834
MR. HWANG DONGHYUN'S INTERVIEW RESULTS

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.459
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU DID NOT PASS

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.626
I'm sorry.

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:21.000
That's why people keep trying,
to get that 10%.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.375
For someone with no hope,
drugs can be like stocks or coins.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.125
LEE KYUNG

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.042
CAN I ORDER 10G? (NEED STRAWS TOO)

00:04:03.346 --> 00:04:04.554
Me?

00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.588
I'm different.

00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:08.999
For me,

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.751
these are like game chips.

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:20.542
To get me to the real prize.

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:31.083
I'm curious.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.074
What else can the lady give me?

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.083
EPISODE 2

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.053
Are you down or not?

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:54.529
I need it tomorrow.
At least 15g up front.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.258
Who are you, huh?

00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:35.083
Wait. The cleaning lady?

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:36.952
What the hell?

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:40.662
Why are you following me?

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:46.292
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.042
Sua's mother?

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:57.584
No way.
What are you doing here?

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:58.626
James.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.636
You're James, aren't you?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.918
No, let me explain.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.083
A guy I know needed
some help at the club.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.209
Count me in.

00:06:15.732 --> 00:06:17.159
- What?
- Let's work together.

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:29.125
Let's be partners.
You and me.

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:03.477
Never imagined I'd meet
a parent like this.

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:07.999
I'm sure I was the one
more surprised.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:12.459
How long have you been
working at Medusa?

00:09:13.856 --> 00:09:16.999
Well, not that long.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.459
When did you start doing this?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.834
Where'd you get it?
I've never seen this.

00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:28.351
Do I really have to tell you?

00:09:28.398 --> 00:09:30.445
I don't buy things
from unknown sources.

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:39.542
Suit yourself.
There are plenty of buyers.

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:40.801
Who?

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:45.271
Tell me. Everyone knows
everyone in the drug scene.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.292
I'll tell you if he's trustworthy.
Free of charge.

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:53.580
Have you forgotten that I caught you?

00:09:54.004 --> 00:09:55.004
So what?

00:09:56.048 --> 00:09:56.830
Huh?

00:09:57.667 --> 00:09:59.916
Are you going to tell everyone about me?

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:04.358
The quiet art tutor
turns out to be a drug dealer...

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.834
There's no reason not to.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:09.218
Then should I tell Sua too?

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:11.061
What her mom came here to sell?

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.500
Remember this.

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:20.145
If you use someone's weakness,
you'll end up with one of your own.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:25.105
Sit down. Let's do business.
We need a contract.

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:31.097
Are we really partnering up?

00:10:46.218 --> 00:10:47.384
Be honest.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:51.182
You came here all relaxed,
didn't you?

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:53.334
Thinking a beating will fix it all, eh?

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.166
Knife.

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:57.795
No, boss.

00:10:57.818 --> 00:10:59.199
Then why are you empty-handed?

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:01.959
Donghyun,
do you know what you lost?

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.658
That drug is way above
your usual shit.

00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:09.042
Specially made for VIP sales
with zero impurities.

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:13.397
And your group's Bongnam stole it
and died before we could even launch.

00:11:13.913 --> 00:11:18.250
If you knew your sins,
you should've brought back the bag.

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:21.626
Isn't that simple common sense?

00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:23.779
Did you really go to college?

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.607
Who ordered Bongnam
to go pick up the drugs?

00:11:26.622 --> 00:11:28.763
It was you, boss!
How is that our fault?

00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:29.999
Shut the fuck up!

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:42.999
Partnership Contract

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:47.876
This contract is between
James and Kang Eunsoo.

00:11:47.918 --> 00:11:51.268
For the purpose of supplying
and selling meth,

00:11:51.354 --> 00:11:53.834
and it lays out the rules
to be followed.

00:11:58.358 --> 00:12:00.108
Don't stop, keep reading.

00:12:00.764 --> 00:12:02.709
Or should we call it off?

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:09.876
One. Kang Eunsoo agrees
to supply meth to James.

00:12:10.542 --> 00:12:15.876
Two. If section one gets leaked
without James's consent,

00:12:15.918 --> 00:12:17.918
the partnership will be terminated.

00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:39.083
Three. If Kang Eunsoo
fails to uphold section two

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:42.834
or is responsible for
causing damage to James,

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:44.542
Kang Eunsoo must compensate.

00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:47.209
Four. If any problem arises

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.334
due to the source of the product,
Kang Eunsoo must take full responsibility.

00:12:59.484 --> 00:13:02.959
Five. The profit will be split
7:3 in favor of James.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:04.999
Are you kidding me?

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.756
Not one bit.

00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:14.611
All you have to do is
provide meth from home.

00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:19.064
I have to distribute and keep
customers happy - so much more work.

00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:24.447
I'll agree on one condition.

00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:30.834
If I become more valuable
than I am now, we renegotiate.

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:35.474
Interesting.

00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:40.292
I look forward to seeing
how valuable you become.

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:46.999
Keep reading.

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:56.559
One question.

00:13:58.117 --> 00:13:59.200
What's the drug's name?

00:13:59.727 --> 00:14:02.203
Itâ€™s too pure
to be just regular meth.

00:14:04.703 --> 00:14:06.584
- Vaka.
- What?

00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:10.667
They look like Vaka peppermint candies.

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:22.254
Pretty catchy name.

00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:25.429
Why do you do this?

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:29.292
You look like a noobie,
and a very scared one.

00:14:31.918 --> 00:14:35.500
I know it's not my business.

00:14:36.815 --> 00:14:37.815
But I'm just curious.

00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:43.023
That's right.
It's none of your business.

00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:15.459
I actually pulled it off.

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:19.999
I... I did it.

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:30.459
Bro!

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:38.417
You bastard, I'll kill you!

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.417
What do we do, bro?

00:15:58.906 --> 00:15:59.906
Junhyun.

00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:06.209
If you don't find the bag,
it won't end with your brother's finger.

00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:08.233
I'll chop his hands and feet.

00:16:09.382 --> 00:16:10.424
You hear me?

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:13.999
I can't hear you.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.999
Yes, I understand.

00:16:39.062 --> 00:16:41.782

GWANGNAM POLICE DRUG UNIT
HUNTS FOR THE MISSING 10KG METH

00:17:51.398 --> 00:17:53.398
Missing meth...

00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:59.998
KIM BONGNAM DIED WHILE FLEEING
THE METH WASN'T FOUND

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:02.159
KIM WAS A MEMBER OF 'PHANTOM',
A DRUG TRAFFICKING GANG

00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:03.999
Phantom...

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:08.500
THE DRUG LOOKS LIKE ICE,
THUS CALLED 'ICE' OR 'CRYSTAL'

00:18:08.774 --> 00:18:10.999
Seizure failed...

00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:22.547
I hope this doesn't screw me over.

00:18:26.334 --> 00:18:29.542
The shape and composition
are different though.

00:18:32.983 --> 00:18:36.151
Argh, why now?

00:18:42.792 --> 00:18:46.542
DELIVERY MAN

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:50.998
The phone you have dialed
is switched off.

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:53.292
Please leave a message
after the beep.

00:19:02.903 --> 00:19:04.459
Huh?

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:06.161
Let go of him! Stop!

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.191
Promise me, Junhyun.
Promise me...

00:19:19.753 --> 00:19:21.456
Bro!

00:19:21.922 --> 00:19:23.968
Let go of me!

00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:34.554
Does it hurt a lot?

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.083
It's not too bad yet.

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.459
You need to start treatment soon.

00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:47.266
I'm sorry.

00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:53.969
About everything.

00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:00.500
Hey...

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:03.390
Do you remember?

00:20:05.135 --> 00:20:10.011
You used to bring home dogs and cats
from the streets all the time.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.918
Especially the ones sick or hurt.

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:19.292
And you didn't even know
you were allergic to fur.

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:23.500
Coughing and sniffling,
saying that you had a cold.

00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:28.471
I was annoyed,
but at the same time,

00:20:28.902 --> 00:20:34.042
I wondered if you married me because
you have a thing for the vulnerable.

00:20:35.647 --> 00:20:38.000
Did I look like I needed help too?

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:42.061
Struggling by myself
with both my parents gone?

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:43.999
No.

00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:47.792
You looked great.

00:20:49.275 --> 00:20:53.692
I admired your drive
for a better life.

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:55.918
That's why I married you.

00:20:59.667 --> 00:21:01.792
Don't let that mind change.

00:21:03.077 --> 00:21:05.912
No matter what I do
or who I become.

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:10.696
Of course.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.999
You've never been wrong.

00:21:26.335 --> 00:21:28.252
I hope I'm not wrong right now.

00:22:06.459 --> 00:22:08.998
Hey chat, can you guess where I am?

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:11.334
Happy birthday, Mimi!

00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.250
Can you wave this way too?

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:17.375
- It's Mimi's birthday!
- Congratulations!

00:22:18.582 --> 00:22:20.871
Chat, guess where I am!

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:23.949
I'm at Mimi's birthday party!

00:22:28.709 --> 00:22:30.375
Did you bring your presents?

00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:40.083
Let's do it one at a time.

00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:46.125
- Congrats!
- Happy birthday!

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.000
Cut it out, Seonjae.

00:22:49.042 --> 00:22:50.500
Why? It's fun!

00:22:51.584 --> 00:22:52.998
Oh, there you are.

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.626
Hey, James.

00:22:54.811 --> 00:22:57.810
Everyone, say hi.
He's the party planner for today.

00:22:57.878 --> 00:22:59.999
Oh, really? Impressive!

00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:03.638
First time seeing them?

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:04.959
This is Seonjae.

00:23:05.328 --> 00:23:07.078
The nephew of
the Vice Minister of Justice.

00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:10.334
This is Hwirim.
Kang Hwirim.

00:23:21.459 --> 00:23:24.626
KANG HWIRIM, BORN JULY 11, 1992,
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TWON HOLDINGS

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:37.569
Hey, Hey! Hurry and hand over
your smartphones.

00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:40.292
We can't upset our
Executive Director Kang, right?

00:23:43.139 --> 00:23:44.891
Do we really have to?

00:23:46.638 --> 00:23:47.721
Don't lose it.

00:23:48.292 --> 00:23:50.542
You're an executive now.
You need to be careful.

00:23:52.447 --> 00:23:56.167
Executive Director already?
You've only worked for two years.

00:23:56.713 --> 00:23:59.709
Why does that matter?
It's his family company.

00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.763
James, you too.

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:07.403
Hurry up.

00:24:17.564 --> 00:24:20.542
Are you James?
I meet you at last.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:22.834
I've heard so much about you.

00:24:23.918 --> 00:24:25.209
Oh.

00:24:26.183 --> 00:24:27.567
Wait a second.

00:24:33.474 --> 00:24:36.557
Familiar face?
I heard you two met.

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:38.999
This is my childhood friend.

00:24:39.615 --> 00:24:41.281
You should've gone easy on him.

00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:45.888
Well, I guess there are always
people like you.

00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:49.167
Thinking you're actually somebody
for getting a little attention.

00:24:50.761 --> 00:24:51.975
It's called crossing the line.

00:24:52.045 --> 00:24:55.082
And they always turn out
to be pathetic losers.

00:24:57.755 --> 00:24:59.672
This party isn't that bad.

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:04.224
Except for the crowd.

00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:08.128
It's the most important.

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:12.636
Chill, this is your
girlfriend's birthday party.

00:25:12.784 --> 00:25:14.417
Who cares about the crowd?

00:25:15.792 --> 00:25:16.999
I like it.

00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:21.918
Hey, can you plan my birthday too?
Something similar to this.

00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:25.251
Bro, he's not even the owner.

00:26:05.334 --> 00:26:06.827
My gift. It's brand new.

00:28:45.209 --> 00:28:48.375
Mom, you're sleeping at the hospital
and coming in the morning, right?

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.366
Yeah, did you eat dinner?

00:28:58.999 --> 00:29:01.553
Yeah, I had bulgogi at Jinhee's.

00:29:01.764 --> 00:29:04.250
Take care, see you tomorrow.
Love you.

00:29:11.751 --> 00:29:13.000
Love you too.

00:29:18.729 --> 00:29:19.959
What the hell am I doing?

00:29:33.712 --> 00:29:35.196
- Sir.
- Yeah?

00:29:36.126 --> 00:29:39.584
It's already been days.
And we got nothing, right?

00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:41.375
So?

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.856
I mean, it's not like we have intel.

00:29:45.864 --> 00:29:49.531
Blindly staking outside a club
doesn't seem efficient.

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.083
Goodness gracious.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:56.742
Smart ass cops
always talk about efficiency.

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.941
Look, we swept Haengbok-dong
and found nothing.

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.999
So next, we search spots
with high chances of drug appearance.

00:30:07.183 --> 00:30:08.597
And we're not here blindly.

00:30:09.066 --> 00:30:11.667
I already called all my lookouts.

00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:13.851
If they see drug activity,
they'll call us.

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:17.688
- Like the club waiters?
- That's right.

00:30:18.093 --> 00:30:21.998
Didn't they fake a report
to cover up their VIPs,

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:24.005
and got you in trouble?

00:30:25.792 --> 00:30:27.000
Well, yeah.

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.701
That was ages ago!

00:30:31.626 --> 00:30:33.999
You remember the dumbest things.

00:30:35.451 --> 00:30:36.866
Are you fucking with me?

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:39.500
No, not at all.

00:30:42.871 --> 00:30:44.079
Eat your burger, asshole.

00:31:25.626 --> 00:31:27.999
I know you like it too.

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:46.292
I'll take care of him.

00:31:50.459 --> 00:31:52.542
I just wanted to touch you.

00:31:52.584 --> 00:31:53.584
What the fuck?

00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:57.093
I know you're a hooker.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.608
What? You crazy bastard!

00:32:00.209 --> 00:32:02.918
He's crazy!
What's wrong with him?

00:32:03.125 --> 00:32:04.375
Move aside.

00:32:08.127 --> 00:32:09.709
- Out you go.
- The fuck?

00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:11.292
- Come on.
- Let me go!

00:32:11.792 --> 00:32:12.999
Let me go!

00:32:35.959 --> 00:32:38.724
You're asking for it, aren't you?

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.500
Do you wanna die?

00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:54.588
I'm going to kill you.

00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:58.999
Hey, do you know something?

00:33:01.682 --> 00:33:03.965
People who actually do kill

00:33:05.934 --> 00:33:10.113
usually act before they talk,
like me.

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:30.584
Are you insane?

00:33:31.198 --> 00:33:33.550
I'm best friends with Hwirim!

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:36.374
You think you'll get away with this?

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:41.030
Fucking coward,
get your head straight.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.725
Just because you're close
doesn't mean his power is yours.

00:33:46.042 --> 00:33:47.998
Now get the fuck out.

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:49.810
And don't come here again.

00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:08.500
How dare you...

00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:12.167
You're nothing...

00:34:39.284 --> 00:34:41.065
What the hell are you staring at?

00:34:47.092 --> 00:34:48.343
Cleaning lady?

00:34:52.334 --> 00:34:55.752
You got me into shit with James.

00:34:59.604 --> 00:35:04.999
I paid so much to get access,
but because of you...

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:14.876
Don't come closer!

00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:22.657
What, is that a gun?

00:35:23.854 --> 00:35:24.854
Shoot me.

00:35:25.837 --> 00:35:28.999
I'm pissed anyway, so bring it on.

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:30.250
Shoot me!

00:35:30.292 --> 00:35:32.312
You think I won't?

00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:36.125
Are you crazy?

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:50.559
Hey, you piss me off too.

00:35:52.395 --> 00:35:56.959
Come on, bring it on!

00:35:56.999 --> 00:36:01.876
Bring it, you little... pussy!

00:36:02.918 --> 00:36:04.459
Crazy bitch!

00:36:16.334 --> 00:36:19.999
I can't believe I actually cursed.
Gosh...

00:36:36.469 --> 00:36:37.843
What the hell?

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:53.542
There's been an accident!

00:36:54.789 --> 00:36:57.209
- There's someone inside.
- He looks badly hurt.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.751
Honey, call for help.

00:36:58.792 --> 00:37:02.250
- Who should I call?
- Call 119.

00:37:02.292 --> 00:37:03.542
Holy moly...

00:37:05.331 --> 00:37:10.000
Hello?

00:37:10.042 --> 00:37:11.584
Yes, uh...

00:37:14.876 --> 00:37:16.167
Lighten up.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.250
Mimi, cheer up.

00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:26.918
There are always people like him,
who think they're something

00:37:26.959 --> 00:37:29.918
just cuz they got a little attention.

00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:33.654
One should never cross the line.

00:37:36.626 --> 00:37:37.584
Right?

00:37:37.638 --> 00:37:40.178
Of course, it's important.

00:37:40.412 --> 00:37:42.999
Looks like our new friend
won't be crossing his.

00:37:48.447 --> 00:37:50.834
What was it called? Vaka?

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.709
This is ice, right?

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:57.500
I've never seen it in this shape.

00:37:58.417 --> 00:38:00.083
Not bad!

00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:03.302
Not bad?
More like fucking awesome.

00:38:04.452 --> 00:38:07.195
This is sick,
where'd you get it?

00:38:10.053 --> 00:38:13.266
How much?
I'll pay whatever you want.

00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:28.255
You look damn familiar.

00:38:31.968 --> 00:38:33.062
Don't you know me?

00:38:36.125 --> 00:38:37.876
Careful, hold him still.

00:38:38.751 --> 00:38:39.792
All set.

00:38:42.459 --> 00:38:43.709
Police...

00:38:59.584 --> 00:39:00.918
- Is this the car?
- Yes.

00:39:37.366 --> 00:39:41.593
What are you saying?
Hey, are you hitting on him?

00:39:46.558 --> 00:39:48.266
Watch your mouth, Sunjae.

00:39:56.375 --> 00:39:57.998
Sorry, sorry, alright?

00:39:57.999 --> 00:40:00.876
Our Hwirim's tough as always.

00:40:01.929 --> 00:40:03.639
That hurt.

00:40:03.751 --> 00:40:05.615
Guess I've got a common face.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.667
Oh, I wish that were true.

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:09.999
You're too good-looking.

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:15.658
But seriously, where are you from?
I'm curious too.

00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:20.334
I don't know you,
so you're not from here. Overseas?

00:40:21.214 --> 00:40:23.547
No, all the overseas
know each other.

00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:34.209
Don't tell me...
A club host?

00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:37.999
Yes, that kinda makes sense.

00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:40.334
Then there's no way I wouldn't know.

00:40:40.618 --> 00:40:41.792
Let me guess.

00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.584
Gwangnam? Or Itaewon?

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:47.999
Right? Come on, tell us.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:52.250
Relax, we don't have to rush things.

00:40:52.292 --> 00:40:55.584
Tonight we drink till we drop, okay?
Drink up!

00:40:55.626 --> 00:40:57.792
Let's drink!

00:41:19.038 --> 00:41:22.038
It's identical to the one
from Kim Bongnam's motel room.

00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:28.626
Where did he come from?

00:41:28.792 --> 00:41:31.834
I think from the parking lot...

00:41:31.876 --> 00:41:33.999
Should we check the security cameras?

00:42:12.876 --> 00:42:13.999
Mr. Lee!

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:17.375
Mr. Lee!

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:21.584
Mr. Lee!

00:42:26.918 --> 00:42:28.042
What the hell!

00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:29.999
Stop shoving!

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.042
What's your problem?

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.083
Mr. Lee!

00:42:34.918 --> 00:42:35.918
Here...

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:47.918
PARK BOHEE

00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:48.999
Do you have a warrant?

00:42:59.195 --> 00:43:00.943
At least one of you gets it.

00:43:00.991 --> 00:43:02.534
Huh? What does he mean?

00:43:03.085 --> 00:43:05.140
It means we don't need a warrant.

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:07.209
Alright, let's go.

00:43:19.542 --> 00:43:20.542
Wait.

00:43:27.042 --> 00:43:28.042
Mr. Lee!

00:43:30.751 --> 00:43:32.375
Hey! Over here!

00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:35.209
Lee Kyung! Lee Kyung!

00:43:37.019 --> 00:43:38.100
Mr. Lee!

00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:40.375
Run!

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.626
James.

00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:02.709
What are you staring at?

00:44:03.459 --> 00:44:04.500
The cops are here.

00:44:06.083 --> 00:44:07.998
Should we move to the next spot?

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:12.442
Next spot?
Yes, that sounds fun.

00:44:13.792 --> 00:44:14.998
Let's go for round two!

00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:16.542
Bro, it's me.
You open tonight?

00:44:17.792 --> 00:44:19.500
Let me rent out your whole bar.

00:44:19.542 --> 00:44:22.000
I'll pay double your sales,
so clear all the tables.

00:44:23.914 --> 00:44:26.125
Hey, I want an explanation.

00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:29.334
You can trust him.

00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:30.834
Run, hurry!

00:44:38.792 --> 00:44:40.709
Let's go to round two!

00:44:45.876 --> 00:44:48.667
Police! Please step aside.

00:44:58.042 --> 00:45:00.459
- Coming through!
- Step aside!

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.626
Excuse me!

00:45:01.667 --> 00:45:03.667
- Hold on!
- Police!

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:06.250
Coming through!

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.125
Please make way!

00:45:17.999 --> 00:45:19.918
Passing through!

00:45:19.959 --> 00:45:22.542
- Move aside!
- Coming through!

00:45:25.292 --> 00:45:26.876
Please make way!

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.243
- Secure the security camera footage.
- Yes, sir.

00:45:50.108 --> 00:45:51.276
Watch it!

00:46:19.959 --> 00:46:21.042
What's going on?

00:46:21.083 --> 00:46:24.959
Erase the hallway
and VIP rooms 1, 2, and 3.

00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:25.999
Understood.

00:46:26.709 --> 00:46:28.292
Don't touch anything.

00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:31.626
Gwangnam Drug Crimes Unit.
We're taking over.

00:46:41.626 --> 00:46:42.709
Just a moment.

00:46:44.999 --> 00:46:45.999
I want a constant update.

00:46:48.667 --> 00:46:50.626
Entering the VIP hallway.

00:47:00.709 --> 00:47:02.542
They just went into room 3.

00:47:17.292 --> 00:47:18.999
Coming through.

00:47:21.918 --> 00:47:23.673
Yes, yes, go that way.

00:47:26.999 --> 00:47:28.959
Hey! What's going on?

00:47:30.504 --> 00:47:32.584
Oh, no.
It shut down.

00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:38.918
The fuck...?

00:47:40.626 --> 00:47:42.209
Is this the right place?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.250
Where the hell did they go?

00:47:49.999 --> 00:47:51.083
Are you sure it's room 3?

00:48:09.999 --> 00:48:11.626
- What? Room 3?
- Room 3?

00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:12.999
- It's Room 3.
- Room 3!

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.667
Search the place.

00:48:14.709 --> 00:48:15.709
Room 3...

00:48:18.959 --> 00:48:20.125
Room 3...

00:49:15.209 --> 00:49:17.334
Let's go!

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.876
I'm telling you,
we don't sell that kind of stuff!

00:49:52.915 --> 00:49:56.930
Why are you ruining our business
based on shady leads?

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.999
Are you going to cover the loss?

00:49:59.375 --> 00:50:01.042
Will the police pay for it all?

00:50:02.293 --> 00:50:05.125
I'm going to sue for damages, okay?

00:50:13.999 --> 00:50:16.593
Sir, the security footages are gone.

00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:54.959
So, how was your first day?

00:50:58.834 --> 00:51:00.042
Ah...

00:51:01.922 --> 00:51:03.959
Is that how you usually party?

00:51:03.999 --> 00:51:07.792
With those people?
With your customers?

00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:10.746
Were you expecting me
to play hopscotch, or what?

00:51:15.098 --> 00:51:17.265
Don't be a wuss.

00:51:20.776 --> 00:51:24.999
Koreans are messed up.
There's so much bad stuff out there.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.999
Yet they're so paranoid about drugs,
as if it's a vicious virus.

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:31.615
Isn't that what it is?

00:51:33.751 --> 00:51:37.919
Listen, what do you think leads
to more crime in this country?

00:51:37.954 --> 00:51:39.578
Drugs or alcohol?

00:51:40.138 --> 00:51:43.459
Did I do real estate speculation?
Or run a stock scam?

00:51:43.571 --> 00:51:47.500
Honestly, they're worse.
The whole nation gets hurt.

00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:51.998
But with this, no one gets hurt.

00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:55.629
No one forces it.
They do it because they want to.

00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:01.403
- Try it if you're curious.
- No, no. I don't want to.

00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:03.460
Scaredy-cat.

00:52:06.709 --> 00:52:09.859
If it's no big deal,
why don't you do it?

00:52:12.477 --> 00:52:16.000
Everyone was drinking
Vaka with champagne.

00:52:16.042 --> 00:52:18.375
But you didn't drink it.

00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:26.167
How did you notice?
You've got sharp eyes.

00:52:28.257 --> 00:52:31.459
- I've got an eye for detail...
- Stop showing off.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.999
How about you give a hand?
Help with the count.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920
Sure.

00:52:57.147 --> 00:52:59.619
I split my tip 7:3 as well.

00:52:59.646 --> 00:53:03.936
It's my token of thanks
for helping me out today unexpectedly.

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.333
And don't be curious about me anymore.

00:53:23.999 --> 00:53:25.209
Okay.

00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:30.456
Are we done?

00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:32.250
Wait.

00:53:33.141 --> 00:53:34.542
What now?

00:53:34.703 --> 00:53:36.411
How much will you bring next time?

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:40.250
The customers loved it.
We'll need a lot more.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.684
Or you could just hand over
everything you have.

00:53:45.424 --> 00:53:48.131
What?
Are you that rich?

00:53:50.584 --> 00:53:51.999
How much do you have?

00:53:55.918 --> 00:53:56.999
One kilogram.

00:53:58.999 --> 00:54:00.334
One kilogram...

00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:04.999
That is quite a lot.

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.999
Fine, I can buy that amount in cash.

00:54:12.696 --> 00:54:13.944
I'll think about it.

00:54:30.036 --> 00:54:31.209
DELIVERY MAN

00:54:33.999 --> 00:54:35.417
Press one for voice mail...

00:54:39.334 --> 00:54:42.209
It's me.
Let's talk offline.

00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:06.432
Are you okay?

00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:09.751
I'm fine!

00:55:16.999 --> 00:55:19.959
Sorry, thank you.

00:56:09.936 --> 00:56:11.229
5 million won.

00:56:12.626 --> 00:56:16.209
This is more than my 3 months'
worth of salary at the store.

00:56:22.334 --> 00:56:24.000
5 million won a day...

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.667
You just got here?

00:57:26.459 --> 00:57:28.334
Yeah, go to sleep.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.200
Mom, did you cry?

00:57:33.257 --> 00:57:34.966
No.

00:57:38.959 --> 00:57:42.000
Lair.
You're really swollen.

00:57:44.375 --> 00:57:46.167
Is something wrong with Dad?

00:57:51.125 --> 00:57:52.792
Did you have a nightmare?

00:57:53.297 --> 00:57:55.464
It's because you didn't sleep well.

00:57:56.584 --> 00:57:58.626
Don't sleep at the hospital.

00:58:01.626 --> 00:58:05.459
No, I had a good dream.

00:58:06.584 --> 00:58:08.998
A really good dream.

00:58:08.999 --> 00:58:11.704
I cried because it was so nice.

00:58:11.774 --> 00:58:17.876
Dummy. Then you should be
smiling, not crying.

00:58:19.735 --> 00:58:21.234
True...

00:59:35.792 --> 00:59:37.042
The sample you mentioned.

00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:40.171
What do you know about it?

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.667
I'm not sure yet.
I'll compare it with this first.

00:59:47.865 --> 00:59:48.742
Are you kidding me?

00:59:48.769 --> 00:59:53.018
Stop. If you look at my face,
the deal's over.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:03.807
Sit down.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.367
Stop acting like a kid.

01:00:22.226 --> 01:00:25.236
What will you do
when you catch the thief?

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:29.080
You really don't know?

01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:36.792
Alright.
Wait for my call.

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:43.744
Hey, where did you lose
the drug bag again?

01:00:46.445 --> 01:00:48.198
Payment for Park Dojin.

01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:51.093
Yes, one moment.

01:01:18.999 --> 01:01:20.998
KANG EUNSOO

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:21.999
PHANTOM

01:02:04.769 --> 01:02:07.139
Where'd you get it?
I've never seen this.

01:02:10.162 --> 01:02:12.667
Do I really have to tell you?

01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:14.999
I don't buy things
from unknown sources.

01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:49.542
Long time no see.

01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:53.676
Girls, let's welcome back Sua.
Applause!

01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:05.792
As I said,
today we'll practice coloring.

01:03:05.834 --> 01:03:07.999
- Take out your stuff.
- Yes, Mr. Lee.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:20.921
Did you change your brush?

01:03:23.709 --> 01:03:24.999
Wow.

01:03:25.662 --> 01:03:28.498
It looks expensive, lucky you.

01:03:28.918 --> 01:03:32.834
Whoa, new paints too?
Way to go, Sua.

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:34.209
You went flexing.

01:03:35.292 --> 01:03:37.551
Girls, look at Sua's paints.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.654
Wow, what is that?

01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:46.167
- It's amazing.
- It's really pretty.

01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:48.626
- The colors are so nice.
- Right?

01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:51.266
- I want one too.
- Me too.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.417
It's really pretty.

01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:54.000
It's crazy nice.

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.998
Enough looking
and get ready for class.

01:03:57.999 --> 01:03:59.709
- Yes, Mr. Lee.
- Yes, Mr. Lee.

01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:16.148
Don't worry, Sua.
Mommy loves you.

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:50.923
Are these three it?

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:52.423
Yes.

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:55.743
Wait, what's wrong with your finger?

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:57.825
Are you sure you can deliver it?

01:04:58.334 --> 01:05:01.138
Yeah, it's just a small injury.

01:05:39.893 --> 01:05:44.853
Boss, what should I do with the thief?

01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:47.334
- Kill 'em.
- Kill...?

01:05:48.459 --> 01:05:50.542
Where did you lose
the drug bag again?

01:05:50.693 --> 01:05:53.192
Haengbok-dong redevelopment zone.

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:37.042
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:42.144
Do you know
how I survived in this industry?

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.113
I have no interest in you.

01:06:44.394 --> 01:06:47.250
All I need to know
is the guy who brought the drugs.

01:06:47.292 --> 01:06:50.375
I never take risks.

01:06:50.827 --> 01:06:52.876
I'll do anything.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.676
Then hand everything over.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.126
The whole stolen bag.

01:06:57.182 --> 01:06:59.792
Between my husband's medical bills
and the house mortgage,

01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:01.502
186.7 million won.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:02.876
That's all I need to get.

01:07:03.244 --> 01:07:06.042
I'll at least spare your life.

01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:10.209
Let's just die together, Mr. Lee.
