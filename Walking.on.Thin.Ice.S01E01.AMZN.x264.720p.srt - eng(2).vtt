WEBVTT

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.949
WALKING ON THIN ICE

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:44.940
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.381
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:48.149
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:03.950
From the beginning through to now,

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.909
it may all have been predestined.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:31.899
Then versus now...

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.775
Which one's worse?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.359
One thing's very clear.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.818
Compared to back then,

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.267
it's so much easier now.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.849
EPISODE 1

00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:57.933
It was announced that
full or partial restrictions

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:00.768
will be in place
from 6 am to 11 am,

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.975
and citizens are requested to cooperate.

00:04:03.017 --> 00:04:06.350
Darling, are you done washing?

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:10.184
With reports of cryptocurrency
investment fraud continuing daily,

00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:13.184
authorities urged the public
to be cautious when investing.

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.975
Take a seat.
Let's eat.

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:18.559
Are you taking cooking classes?

00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:23.059
Your Dad's been losing weight, okay?
He looks like a walking stick.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.849
Will you cook the same
if I lose weight?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.684
- Sure, but you never lose weight.
- Whatever.

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:28.849
Bon appétit.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.850
You barely slept, right?

00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:34.848
You kept tossing and turning.
Look how pale you are.

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.642
- You're worrying me.
- I'm fine.

00:04:37.684 --> 00:04:40.849
The bank people must think
you keep Dad up all night.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.157
What? I'm fifteen.
It's a joke, okay?

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.059
Unbelievable.

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.017
Eat up.
We'll talk when you get taller.

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.559
- You can have mine, beloved father.
- No chance.

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:02.392
This is way too much.

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:07.768
Bye, Mom.

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.559
Sua, hold on a second.

00:05:12.392 --> 00:05:13.933
I didn't do makeup.

00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:16.849
Schools aren't that strict anymore.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.267
And there...

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:22.059
Alright, there we go.

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.081
All pretty now.

00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:28.684
I love you.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.142
- Yes, yes. I love you too.
- Love you.

00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:35.849
- I have to go now.
- Okay, take care.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.420
Hey, Sua!

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:42.849
- Bye bye!
- Yeah!

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.434
Oh! Hey there, sweetie!

00:05:53.142 --> 00:05:54.849
That's for you.

00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:57.933
Hey, Sua!

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.892
How'd you recognize me so fast?

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:06.642
You're the only one
who wears a knee-length skirt.

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:09.849
And you're the only one
who rides a five-minute walk to school.

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:11.892
It's seven minutes.

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:17.726
Anyway, can't you shorten
that skirt by just an inch?

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:20.350
I'll show you the best place
to get it done.

00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:21.392
Mom won't approve.

00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:23.392
You're such a mama's girl.

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:26.517
What about you?
You always obey your mom too.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.642
I do it because I'm scared.

00:06:39.684 --> 00:06:41.517
But you love your mom.

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.043
Everyone loves their mom.

00:06:44.136 --> 00:06:45.849
No, I don't.

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:48.017
How can you say that?

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:53.848
Hey! Why aren't you
answering the phone?

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.309
The cops are on us.
Grab the cash and get out, now!

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.892
The Phantoms are on us too.
We'll die if we get caught!

00:07:28.473 --> 00:07:30.309
Wow, you're really something.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.059
How can you be so accurate
without measuring the scale?

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.142
Is it because you were a banker?

00:07:36.392 --> 00:07:38.849
Anyone can do it
after a month on the job.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:43.267
Really? But I've been here six months...

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.848
Oh, by the way!

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:48.849
I heard your neighborhood's
getting redeveloped. Congrats.

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:53.267
That only concerns
real estate speculators.

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:55.392
It's got nothing to do
with people like me.

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:59.480
Look, I don't need billions.
My dream is to have a small place

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:01.358
to live with my family.

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:07.184
Wait, haven't you already achieved that?

00:08:07.568 --> 00:08:09.152
You're living your dream.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.210
OFF-SHAPE APPLES
15,900 WON FOR 3KG

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.017
Stupid cops!
They almost ran him over!

00:08:19.504 --> 00:08:20.587
Gosh, that was close.

00:08:23.064 --> 00:08:26.601
You're done already,
even without Donghyun?

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.100
So how many kilos in total?

00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:33.309
Well, 39 bundles at 3kg each,
so just under 120kg.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.267
Amazing, you're a human calculator.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.017
- And the order?
- Already done.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.246
Mister, we have a delivery.
20kg of cabbage to Daepo Restaurant.

00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:46.060
- 20kg? Got it.
- Yes.

00:08:47.684 --> 00:08:50.637
Oh, I put your takeaway
at the counter.

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:52.968
Aw, thank you!

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.718
Hey, crackheads!

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:58.892
Hurry up, quick!

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:01.975
Hey, stop-stop.
Put it down, put it down.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.671
Stay away, bastard!

00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:17.142
No, you don't.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.913
Enough running already.

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.146
Stay put.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:09:59.630
Alright, alright, alright.

00:10:24.533 --> 00:10:26.267
Damn, what a pain.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:30.933
Mr. Crackhead, you have the right
to remain silent.

00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:32.848
You may hire a lawyer,

00:10:32.849 --> 00:10:38.017
and anything you say
can be used against you in court.

00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:41.087
College students?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.243
Do your parents know?

00:10:45.524 --> 00:10:47.337
That their kids wish
to become drug lords?

00:10:47.768 --> 00:10:49.559
How dare you

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:53.059
show up here

00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:55.504
to buy stolen drugs?

00:10:56.517 --> 00:10:57.517
Huh?

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:00.975
Damn, where is it?

00:11:01.726 --> 00:11:03.392
Check outside too.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.718
- Detective.
- Yeah.

00:11:07.849 --> 00:11:10.476
From now on,
just stay in the office, okay?

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:11.768
You screw up every time!

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:14.434
If it wasn't for him,
we would've lost them all.

00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:16.601
Forget it, alright?

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:21.003
You even quit med school
because blood scared you.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.559
Sir, the money is right here.

00:11:28.085 --> 00:11:29.601
- Sir.
- What?

00:11:29.725 --> 00:11:31.559
They don't have any drugs.

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:34.849
Bastards, where's the drug bag?

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:49.892
Shit. These bastards
are driving me crazy.

00:11:49.933 --> 00:11:52.726
Give me a break,
you Phantom bastards!

00:11:52.768 --> 00:11:54.476
Junhyun, get closer.

00:11:54.849 --> 00:11:56.809
Where the hell is he going?

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:59.267
- Stop the car!
- Shut your damn mouth!

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:01.849
You fucking traitor!
Stop right now!

00:12:02.434 --> 00:12:03.849
Where are you going, bitch?

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.476
- Stop the car! Stop, you bastard!
- Screw you, damn Phantoms!

00:12:12.517 --> 00:12:13.601
Kim Bongnam, that bastard!

00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:38.506
Junhyun...

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.184
Time to fuck off.

00:12:57.849 --> 00:13:00.476
Argh, seriously?

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:10.152
No, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.476
Hey, hey! Get your ass out!

00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:15.059
Fine, I'll give it back.
Here, here.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.601
Get out!

00:13:16.642 --> 00:13:18.267
Get the fuck out!

00:13:18.849 --> 00:13:21.184
- Just smash it.
- Smash everything!

00:13:24.849 --> 00:13:26.517
Alright, alright.
Here.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:29.225
Enough, enough, enough!

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.849
Shit. Put that down.
Hey, hey!

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:37.642
- Catch him!
- Stop, Bongnam!

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:41.350
- Stop that thief!
- The bag! Get the bag!

00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:44.267
You're dead meat, bitch!

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.849
Stop right there!

00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.850
Stop right there!
I said stop!

00:13:52.142 --> 00:13:53.517
Shut the fuck up!

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:55.392
Hand over the bag!

00:14:14.517 --> 00:14:18.848
What's causing the recent surge
in drug crimes among people?

00:14:18.849 --> 00:14:24.684
Today's guest is Lt. Song Jeongseon
from the Seoul Police Drug Crimes Unit,

00:14:24.726 --> 00:14:27.118
and we'll be talking about
drug crimes among ordinary people.

00:14:27.142 --> 00:14:31.379
Nearly 800 suspects were arrested
just last month alone.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.768
It has literally spread
into our everyday surroundings.

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:36.517
What do you think is the cause?

00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:39.142
Online distribution
has become more active.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.350
Drugs now have much easier access.

00:14:42.711 --> 00:14:46.601
Anyone can search online
and order drugs like food delivery...

00:14:46.642 --> 00:14:48.267
SAERO GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:15:31.726 --> 00:15:34.850
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:40.017
You girls came way too early again.

00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:43.642
And your makeup keep getting thicker.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.184
Put just as much
effort into drawing, okay?

00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:51.225
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:00.632
Ah, I thought I barely ate...

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.116
Honey, any antacids at home?

00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:12.267
NOTICE OF FORCED SEIZURE OF MOVABLE ASSETS

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:15.048
What happened?

00:16:19.849 --> 00:16:23.517
MORTGAGE LOAN

00:16:27.184 --> 00:16:28.601
Crypto?

00:16:29.017 --> 00:16:31.559
You even got a loan against the house?

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:33.684
How much?

00:16:34.668 --> 00:16:36.559
Don't tell me you lost everything.

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:38.710
Say something!

00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:44.199
I'm sorry.

00:16:44.277 --> 00:16:47.892
Wha... What were you thinking?

00:16:48.098 --> 00:16:50.933
Did I ever tell you
to earn more money?

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:53.848
Have I ever nagged you
for never being promoted?

00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:56.100
Or for co-signing a friend's debt,

00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:58.933
or helping your brother buy his house!
Did I say anything?

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:02.681
I was okay with them
because it's in your nature to help.

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:06.949
All I wanted was just this...

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.184
To protect what we already have.
But how could you?

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:16.911
We're short on money
for the additional deposit as it is.

00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:20.368
But now, our house is going up
for auction!

00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:23.142
Where will we live then?

00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:25.251
What about Sua?

00:17:27.642 --> 00:17:28.829
Are you even her father?

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:32.384
Are you really my husband?

00:17:37.449 --> 00:17:39.614
Eunsoo, Eunsoo!

00:17:42.488 --> 00:17:44.905
For the first time,
I actually regret marrying you.

00:17:55.184 --> 00:17:58.768
2014 HAPPY BANK FALL OUTING

00:18:07.226 --> 00:18:10.017
So that's why you ran away?

00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:16.587
Today, I just couldn't bear
to even look at him.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.797
You'll let me sleep over, right?

00:18:22.849 --> 00:18:25.849
Of course, I will.

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:31.017
Don't you dare go back
in a few hours to make breakfast.

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:34.726
Gosh, what am I gonna do?

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:39.267
I have no idea...

00:18:44.392 --> 00:18:48.017
I'll look into employee loans tomorrow.

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:52.017
You'll be able to get twenty million won.

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:53.350
Thanks.

00:18:53.392 --> 00:18:55.517
Why did your husband do that?

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:58.984
He's not the type to invest recklessly.

00:18:59.809 --> 00:19:01.267
I really don't get it.

00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:37.623
Honey?

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:40.279
Sua?

00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:51.642
Where did they go off to?

00:19:55.768 --> 00:19:57.059
Mom, what's wrong?

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.100
Dad!

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:05.768
- Honey!
- What should we do?

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:06.892
Honey!

00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:19.267
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:22.848
The tumor has invaded the vessels
around the pancreas.

00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:25.093
Unfortunately,
surgery won't be possible.

00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:26.849
Things might have been better

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.184
if he started chemo
when he was diagnosed last May.

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:32.684
- But at this point...
- Last May?

00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:35.726
Are you saying my husband knew?

00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:40.120
Well, pancreatic cancer treatment
is expensive and risky.

00:20:40.174 --> 00:20:44.309
There are many patients
who delay or don't tell their families.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:49.017
Has he recently lost a lot of weight,
looked yellow in the face,

00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:51.933
or collapsed from
stomach pain like today?

00:20:58.684 --> 00:21:02.850
If it spreads to his liver or brain,
there's virtually no hope.

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:08.601
He must be admitted right away
and get treated.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:20.768
Eunsoo, I checked
the company loan status.

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:22.848
Your husband already took his at max.

00:21:22.849 --> 00:21:24.933
He took it last summer,
didn't you know?

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:30.975
Hello? Eunsoo?

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:29.726
Oh my God...

00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:35.517
Why would you make breakfast
in that condition?

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:42.559
You're driving me crazy here.
Dear Lord...

00:22:43.476 --> 00:22:44.849
Gosh...

00:22:53.517 --> 00:22:57.684
I have to clean this up too?

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:06.726
PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA

00:23:06.768 --> 00:23:09.849
PANCREATIC CANCER,
THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CANCER

00:23:12.066 --> 00:23:14.885
THE AVERAGE TREATMENT COST FOR
PANCREATIC CANCER IS ABOUT 62 MILLION WON

00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:18.198
MUCH OF IT ISN’T COVERED
BY NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE

00:23:27.726 --> 00:23:31.849
Abdominal CT, MRI, PET-CT,
endoscopic ultrasound...

00:23:32.392 --> 00:23:34.292
Metal stent procedure,
and hemostatic

00:23:34.304 --> 00:23:36.517
injections... That
totals to 1,031,500 won.

00:23:36.849 --> 00:23:41.642
There's a discount for
severe cancer patients, right?

00:23:41.684 --> 00:23:42.849
It's already been applied.

00:23:51.849 --> 00:23:53.892
- Paying in installments?
- Yes, six months.

00:24:03.877 --> 00:24:06.251
I can give you your pay
in advance, don't worry.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:08.809
- Thank you
- Hang in there.

00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:11.809
I heard about Dojin,
but my situation's tight too.

00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:17.059
I know it's a lot to ask,
but is there no way?

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.476
Sorry, I have a meeting to attend.

00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:33.642
He has to start
chemotherapy right away.

00:24:34.392 --> 00:24:38.225
If you could help out
your brother a little,

00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:42.017
it would mean a lot.
Just a little help...

00:24:42.517 --> 00:24:44.892
Stay strong, Eunsoo.
I'll find a way...

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:48.551
Yes, stay strong.

00:25:03.617 --> 00:25:04.848
Seriously?

00:25:04.849 --> 00:25:06.100
Only a million won?

00:25:06.312 --> 00:25:07.849
Wow...

00:25:08.249 --> 00:25:11.559
His brother is about to die, and his
niece is about to become homeless!

00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:15.142
They even took
the entire family inheritance.

00:25:15.184 --> 00:25:19.059
You also gave them tens of millions of won
for their real estate purchase!

00:25:19.257 --> 00:25:21.849
How can they be so shameless?

00:25:27.517 --> 00:25:32.476
Hey! What about his school friends?
Don't they owe him a lot?

00:25:35.684 --> 00:25:36.849
Same story.

00:25:40.045 --> 00:25:43.476
Wow... Those shameless bastards!

00:25:43.517 --> 00:25:45.809
Hey, calm down.

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:49.017
I'm just so upset.
That's why!

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:54.309
He started small and was doing well.
So he got a loan to invest more.

00:25:54.849 --> 00:25:58.439
To leave behind some money
in case he died.

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.309
That's not an excuse.

00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:02.849
I just need 200 million.

00:26:03.787 --> 00:26:07.392
No more, no less.
Just 200 mil.

00:26:16.684 --> 00:26:19.954
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

00:26:25.075 --> 00:26:26.075
What's this?

00:26:27.768 --> 00:26:31.350
Sorry, it's only a million won.

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:50.809
Your million is different
from my brother-in-law's...

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:53.434
I wanted to give you more.

00:26:53.849 --> 00:26:56.199
But my brother's gym
went bankrupt, remember?

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.304
So you've been covering
his living expenses?

00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:03.768
Yeah, I hate blood ties.

00:27:03.849 --> 00:27:07.772
But he got a job recently though.
I was surprised.

00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:11.100
But he's still a trash.

00:27:11.354 --> 00:27:14.823
He wants me to work
part-time in a kitchen.

00:27:15.143 --> 00:27:16.726
And give him the money.

00:27:17.017 --> 00:27:18.100
Hey...

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.686
Do they give salaries in advance?

00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:24.225
It's a club.
You're a mother, remember?

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:27.892
Come on, I can do anything
for my family.

00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.267
The auction will proceed within two weeks.

00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:54.849
We'll inform you of
the exact date and time later.

00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:04.267
- Eat before you go.
- I don't want breakfast.

00:28:05.102 --> 00:28:06.267
Sua!

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.726
Sua!

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:44.559
Delivery!

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:03.738
Who is it?

00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:07.074
Oh, you answered.
I was about to leave this and go.

00:29:07.152 --> 00:29:10.975
Great, it's best to eat
while it's still hot.

00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:13.995
- Leave.
- Yup, have a good one.

00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:41.849
Sorry, I forgot the pickled radish.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.309
Fucking bastard.

00:29:49.933 --> 00:29:51.184
You annoying shit...

00:29:55.559 --> 00:30:00.849
Hey, Bongnam. Your phone's off, and
you don't use credit cards. But for what?

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:04.849
You used a delivery app to order, dumbass.

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:14.225
Oh, you guys are cops!

00:30:17.267 --> 00:30:19.601
Wait, hold on a sec.

00:30:20.017 --> 00:30:22.267
Don't come near me!
Stay away!

00:30:22.772 --> 00:30:23.813
Stay away!

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:33.225
Ah, that tickles.
That tickles!

00:30:33.768 --> 00:30:35.559
Eat this!

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.642
Wow, it's so damn high!

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.850
Hey, do you know who I am?

00:30:48.849 --> 00:30:50.848
I'm Superman!

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:53.142
What a pain in the ass.

00:30:54.476 --> 00:30:57.392
Ah, my leg's broken.

00:30:59.601 --> 00:31:00.642
Bye, now.

00:31:01.517 --> 00:31:02.726
Hey, Kim Bongnam!

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:04.849
Getting comfortable?

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:15.059
Gotcha!

00:31:18.726 --> 00:31:19.975
Crazy bitch.

00:31:24.642 --> 00:31:25.849
Stop!

00:31:27.975 --> 00:31:30.017
Get him already!

00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:37.559
DESIGNATED REDEVELOPMENT ZONE

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:46.059
My husband is Park Dojin.
He should have cancer insurance.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:51.063
I'm sorry,
but he terminated it last fall

00:31:51.146 --> 00:31:53.146
and already took the refund.

00:31:54.949 --> 00:31:57.282
No, that can't be.

00:31:58.849 --> 00:32:02.726
Never mind, I must've forgotten.

00:32:03.933 --> 00:32:09.517
What about my life insurance?

00:32:13.028 --> 00:32:13.875
Yes...

00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:18.185
Would you like to cancel it?

00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:20.184
Oh, no.

00:32:20.225 --> 00:32:25.849
How much is the payout
upon death again?

00:32:32.137 --> 00:32:33.585
It shows as 100 million won.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:36.898
100 million...

00:32:42.849 --> 00:32:45.434
Ma'am? Ma'am?

00:32:45.892 --> 00:32:53.601
Oh, sorry about that.
I'll call you back, thanks.

00:32:57.933 --> 00:32:59.142
Ouch...

00:33:01.517 --> 00:33:02.849
Argh...

00:33:03.684 --> 00:33:04.849
Ah, that hurts...

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.350
Is anyone there?

00:33:20.973 --> 00:33:22.183
Anyone home?

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:39.142
What is this about?

00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:40.849
JANG TAEGU

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:44.849
Police, we need your cooperation.

00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:07.476
- Not up there?
- We got nothing.

00:34:08.684 --> 00:34:09.768
Did you search properly?

00:34:11.142 --> 00:34:13.975
- Any signs?
- No, nothing.

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:19.850
Split up and search.

00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:21.933
You two go up there.
You're with me.

00:34:26.059 --> 00:34:28.434
What was the house address again?

00:34:28.476 --> 00:34:30.850
33-gil? 34-gil?

00:34:30.892 --> 00:34:33.651
Bongnam, get your head straight!

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:35.849
What's wrong?

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:40.717
That man sure walks
like someone I know.

00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:44.975
32-gil 55.32-gil 55.
32-gil 55.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.267
32-gil 55, 32-gil 55...

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:49.642
Bongnam!

00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:16.309
I'm sure there's
a bigger bag somewhere...

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.630
Jump!

00:35:37.772 --> 00:35:40.049
Eat this, you damn cop.

00:35:52.768 --> 00:35:54.849
Bring it.
I'll smash your head open.

00:36:05.809 --> 00:36:08.059
There you are.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.017
Stop following me already.

00:36:17.699 --> 00:36:19.323
Strike!

00:36:21.849 --> 00:36:23.476
Little rat.

00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:25.765
Bongnam, let's go home.

00:36:29.476 --> 00:36:32.059
Don't move!
This is a real gun! Stay away!

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:34.933
- Calm down, man.
- Stay away!

00:36:34.975 --> 00:36:36.476
Catch me if you can.

00:36:36.517 --> 00:36:37.849
- Quit it.
- I'm Superman!

00:36:42.017 --> 00:36:43.017
Hey, hey!

00:37:03.504 --> 00:37:04.879
Is he... dead?

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:08.849
Sir... Sir?

00:37:09.684 --> 00:37:11.284
- No drugs...
- You shouldn't touch him.

00:37:12.225 --> 00:37:13.849
Where are the drugs, you bastard!

00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:33.392
Huh?

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:36.309
Where did this come from?

00:38:01.184 --> 00:38:05.809
Around 5:30 pm today in the redevelopment
zone at Haengbok-dong, Gwangnam...

00:38:05.849 --> 00:38:09.184
By the way, this golf bag.
Is it yours?

00:38:09.849 --> 00:38:12.059
It was full of strange things.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.848
Kim was a member of
the Phantom drug trafficking gang.

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:17.892
Police said Phantom recently smuggled
10kg of meth from Southeast Asia...

00:38:17.933 --> 00:38:21.601
- It's not mine.
- Really? It's not Sua's either.

00:38:21.642 --> 00:38:23.100
Then where did it come from?

00:38:23.142 --> 00:38:26.392
Police succeeded in recovering the body.

00:38:26.434 --> 00:38:29.434
- But they failed to obtain the meth...
- Huh? Wait.

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:31.059
- which he had fled with.
- Why?

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.392
Police are backtracking Kim's
escape route for the meth bag.

00:38:36.434 --> 00:38:42.111
This crystallized drug resembles ice,
and thus is called 'Ice' or 'Crystal'.

00:38:42.225 --> 00:38:44.849
It was recently
smuggled in from Vietnam.

00:38:45.476 --> 00:38:47.892
Based in clubs around Gwangnam,

00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:51.476
the Phantom drug gang
has recently grown rapidly.

00:38:51.517 --> 00:38:55.684
Unlike the gangs of the past, they
operated virtually and in small cells.

00:38:55.726 --> 00:39:00.142
Their true identity is hidden,
hence the name Phantom.

00:39:00.184 --> 00:39:02.849
- It looks like a candy.
- The cautiously operating gang

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:07.559
recently left behind a trail
due to their gang member, Kim Bongnam.

00:39:08.225 --> 00:39:13.267
The police got intel about
10kg of meth being smuggled in,

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:14.849
and surveilled Kim.

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:21.434
The 10kg of meth had come in
from Vietnam a week ago.

00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:25.601
A taxi driver reported on Kim
for acting weird in the back seat

00:39:25.642 --> 00:39:29.850
and being suspicious
while carrying a heavy bag.

00:39:30.529 --> 00:39:35.848
Kim used the subway and the bus
from Seoul to Incheon...

00:39:35.849 --> 00:39:37.309
I don't feel anything.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:43.476
Don't overthink it.
There's no drug in this neighborhood.

00:39:44.251 --> 00:39:47.434
Police traced back
the delivery app Kim used

00:39:47.476 --> 00:39:50.142
and raided the motel where Kim was hiding.

00:39:50.184 --> 00:39:54.562
After recklessly jumping off
a building in an attempt to escape,

00:39:54.663 --> 00:39:56.955
Kim eventually ended up dead.

00:39:57.686 --> 00:39:59.397
- Kim betrayed the gang...
- It looks the same!

00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:03.892
and tried to steal the drugs
with his acquaintances.

00:40:03.933 --> 00:40:09.225
Holy! Are these actually real?

00:40:10.768 --> 00:40:12.933
But how did it end up here?

00:40:15.184 --> 00:40:18.184
Wait a second...
Who brought it here?

00:40:37.933 --> 00:40:40.559
Hold on, think.

00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:44.684
while stealing drugs and running away.

00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:50.392
We can see how deeply
drugs have infiltrated our daily lives.

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:53.293
Trades by tossing
happen in residential areas.

00:40:53.332 --> 00:40:55.012
Calm down.

00:40:55.035 --> 00:41:01.225
The ones doing the tossing are
students, housewives,

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:05.142
and ordinary people
who'll avoid suspicion.

00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:10.217
Meanwhile, the Phantom
drug trafficking gang...

00:41:10.264 --> 00:41:14.768
- has earned over 200 million won a month.
- 911, what's your emergency?

00:41:15.517 --> 00:41:16.849
Hello?

00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:20.309
Can you hear me? Hello?

00:41:20.892 --> 00:41:22.184
200 million?

00:41:24.474 --> 00:41:26.098
200 million every month?

00:41:31.434 --> 00:41:32.768
With this?

00:41:37.392 --> 00:41:38.768
Kang Eunsoo?

00:41:42.392 --> 00:41:43.768
Kang Eunsoo?

00:41:44.543 --> 00:41:45.543
Ah, yes.

00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:49.850
You're here through Manager Baek?
To work in the kitchen?

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.517
- Yes.
- Damn.

00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:55.849
You're unlucky.
We already hired someone.

00:41:57.065 --> 00:42:00.435
Are you okay with other work
besides kitchen duty?

00:42:02.005 --> 00:42:03.601
Yes, of course.

00:42:12.642 --> 00:42:16.433
You'll see nasty things in club toilets.
Try to ignore.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:35.184
The Phantom drug trafficking gang has
earned over 200 million won a month.

00:42:45.235 --> 00:42:47.902
Have you all been
on vacation or something?

00:42:48.547 --> 00:42:51.421
- No, sir.
- Were you lazing off?

00:42:53.107 --> 00:42:54.004
No, sir.

00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:56.654
How could you not find the bag
with so many people?

00:42:58.849 --> 00:43:01.059
It's messy as it is
with the suspect dead.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.642
If you don't find those drugs,
I'll get screwed.

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:07.849
And that means all of you
will get screwed too.

00:43:39.285 --> 00:43:41.950
Hey, you're all gonna get
ass-cramps.

00:43:42.684 --> 00:43:47.184
Go door to door,
stake out in clubs, or do whatever.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:51.684
Don't sit there like idiots.
You hear me?

00:43:55.318 --> 00:43:56.318
Everyone, outside.

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:08.392
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:29.601
ART TEACHER

00:44:32.039 --> 00:44:33.392
Sua's mom speaking.

00:44:33.724 --> 00:44:35.849
Sua hasn't been coming to class?

00:44:37.267 --> 00:44:41.849
For a whole week?
That can't be...

00:44:42.434 --> 00:44:46.492
My daughter loves art class,
more than anything else.

00:44:46.642 --> 00:44:48.434
Yes, I'm aware of that.

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:54.768
I can tell apart between those
who love art and those who're forced.

00:44:54.809 --> 00:44:56.996
But why...

00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:06.338
Is there something you know?

00:45:08.822 --> 00:45:14.100
Well, I could be wrong...

00:45:21.742 --> 00:45:23.559
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

00:45:34.517 --> 00:45:35.559
Are you okay?

00:45:36.642 --> 00:45:37.642
Did you get burnt?

00:45:37.684 --> 00:45:42.390
Sorry, I have to go.
Thank you for calling me.

00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:50.809
Quitting school?

00:45:51.479 --> 00:45:54.971
You can't just quit school
out of nowhere, okay?

00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:59.068
If I go absent for three months,
I can file a withdrawal.

00:45:59.146 --> 00:46:02.428
What are you saying?
It's already difficult as it is!

00:46:02.443 --> 00:46:06.142
Exactly! Dad collapsed,
and we're about to get kicked out.

00:46:06.326 --> 00:46:08.369
How can I keep painting
and go to school?

00:46:09.384 --> 00:46:10.478
It's impossible.

00:46:12.384 --> 00:46:17.470
Sua, it's not as bad as you think.

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.601
Mom will take care of it.

00:46:20.216 --> 00:46:24.294
You're only fifteen. If you drop out now,
what will you become later?

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.310
Yes, I'm fifteen.

00:46:27.575 --> 00:46:29.850
Why do you keep
treating me like I'm five?

00:46:29.892 --> 00:46:33.165
The situation's not that bad?
You'll take care of it?

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.136
Liar...

00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:39.849
I can see and hear.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

00:46:41.559 --> 00:46:45.184
You've been borrowing money everywhere
and even sold your wedding ring!

00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:48.855
I'm not acting impulsively.

00:46:49.184 --> 00:46:50.684
I thought a lot about this.

00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:56.184
For now, I'll work part-time
and help pay for Dad's treatment.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.642
I can take the GED for school.

00:46:59.577 --> 00:47:00.743
As for painting...

00:47:02.296 --> 00:47:03.684
I don't need it anymore.

00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:06.309
It's not like I'll die without it.

00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:11.059
But Dad will die.

00:47:14.178 --> 00:47:15.892
Dad will die without money.

00:47:46.837 --> 00:47:47.837
Is that weed?

00:47:50.392 --> 00:47:52.849
Wow, it has no scent.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.908
It's like a cigarette.
Where'd you get it?

00:47:55.954 --> 00:47:57.100
James.

00:47:57.311 --> 00:48:00.201
Oh, the new dealer you found?

00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:02.849
How is he?
Is he good-looking?

00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:08.250
He's coming later.
Wanna see him?

00:48:08.881 --> 00:48:09.881
Yeah.

00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:16.682
More than enough.

00:48:18.601 --> 00:48:21.225
Let's see how cute this James is.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.100
I saw the news.
What happened?

00:49:10.392 --> 00:49:12.934
Something came up.

00:49:13.476 --> 00:49:15.642
I can't go into detail.

00:49:16.684 --> 00:49:19.892
I need more time
to get your stuff.

00:49:19.933 --> 00:49:23.933
You already took my money
for the new drugs. What the fuck?

00:49:24.726 --> 00:49:27.142
I can't believe I even listened to you.

00:49:27.362 --> 00:49:29.309
Enough. Let me speak to your boss.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:33.892
Listen, I'll call you back
as soon as I get it.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.639
Hey! Hey!

00:49:49.434 --> 00:49:50.517
BOSS

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.892
Yes, boss.

00:49:56.933 --> 00:50:00.726
Damn idiots!
How could they fuck up now?

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:03.684
We're almost out of stock...

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.089
James!

00:50:06.476 --> 00:50:07.849
There you are.

00:50:09.103 --> 00:50:10.392
Got anything on you?

00:50:18.017 --> 00:50:19.809
I know you don't take checks.

00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:21.319
It's an advanced payment
for this weekend.

00:50:21.483 --> 00:50:23.483
You know who's coming, right?

00:50:23.514 --> 00:50:25.692
This amount won't cut it.

00:50:25.755 --> 00:50:27.271
They're used to bigger stuff.

00:50:27.325 --> 00:50:29.177
Don't worry.
I'm always ready.

00:50:29.224 --> 00:50:31.641
Great, come on.
I'll introduce you to Sujin.

00:50:31.727 --> 00:50:33.673
- The daughter of W Entertainment.
- Sure.

00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:48.849
James?

00:50:49.267 --> 00:50:51.349
He only deals with VIPs.
Why?

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:57.152
- Oh, he left something behind.
- Okay, wait.

00:50:59.295 --> 00:51:00.919
Look, he's over there.

00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:03.613
Over there, with glasses.

00:51:04.267 --> 00:51:06.850
Next to the rabbit.

00:51:06.892 --> 00:51:09.849
- That's James, right?
- Him?

00:51:11.849 --> 00:51:13.517
Yeah, I think that's James.

00:51:46.601 --> 00:51:48.651
We gave him
painkillers, so he'll be fine.

00:51:49.108 --> 00:51:49.795
Okay.

00:51:54.726 --> 00:51:58.309
- How are you feeling?
- It hurts.

00:52:33.512 --> 00:52:34.701
Honey, I'm here...

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.849
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

00:53:44.676 --> 00:53:45.676
Honey.

00:53:47.517 --> 00:53:48.975
Why are you here?

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.559
Hey, I just felt suffocated.

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:55.918
Needed some air.

00:53:56.254 --> 00:54:01.270
But you can't be up there.
Everyone got startled.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.425
If you're feeling stuffy,
should we go for a walk?

00:54:05.606 --> 00:54:07.439
Let's go eat out.

00:54:08.332 --> 00:54:11.644
- Will that be okay, Doctor?
- Yes, of course. Anytime.

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:16.767
We can call Sua too.
And have a family dinner.

00:54:17.025 --> 00:54:17.955
You know...

00:54:20.177 --> 00:54:21.469
I regret it too.

00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:23.849
What?

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.489
I regret marrying you.

00:54:27.193 --> 00:54:28.771
If it hadn't been me,

00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:33.059
you could've lived more comfortably.

00:54:34.138 --> 00:54:35.768
You could've been happier.

00:54:37.071 --> 00:54:41.267
I thought I could
make you and Sua...

00:54:42.469 --> 00:54:45.684
live a really happy life.

00:54:51.013 --> 00:54:52.013
Honey.

00:54:53.175 --> 00:54:54.800
I never thought...

00:54:56.476 --> 00:54:58.267
I'd end up like this.

00:55:00.485 --> 00:55:03.104
I took everything away from you both.

00:55:04.626 --> 00:55:06.626
No, that's not true.

00:55:07.809 --> 00:55:10.873
Stop, don't talk like that.
It's not true.

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:11.974
Eunsoo.

00:55:16.416 --> 00:55:17.576
I'm sorry.

00:55:41.802 --> 00:55:43.881
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

00:55:55.642 --> 00:55:57.601
Uh, ma'am...

00:55:58.849 --> 00:56:01.090
We understand you're shocked.

00:56:01.598 --> 00:56:03.785
There's nothing I can say
to comfort you.

00:56:03.887 --> 00:56:07.476
But we need to know
how you'd like to proceed.

00:56:09.849 --> 00:56:10.849
No...

00:56:12.225 --> 00:56:15.726
My husband is gone...

00:56:19.766 --> 00:56:21.473
What should I do?

00:56:24.052 --> 00:56:25.262
I need to go home.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:27.833
Excuse me?

00:56:28.642 --> 00:56:29.849
Ma'am?

00:56:31.394 --> 00:56:32.489
Ma'am!

00:57:13.052 --> 00:57:14.261
No!

00:57:35.684 --> 00:57:36.684
Lift him up!

00:57:50.705 --> 00:57:52.454
We're not losing the house.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:55.849
And you're not dying.

00:57:56.142 --> 00:57:57.809
I'll protect everything.

00:57:57.981 --> 00:58:00.191
So just stay by my side.

00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:02.142
Just stay alive.

00:58:02.849 --> 00:58:04.225
If you die...

00:58:04.768 --> 00:58:06.267
Me and Sua will...

00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:09.187
We'll lose everything.

00:59:05.849 --> 00:59:06.850
Sua.

00:59:13.036 --> 00:59:15.454
Don't skip school.

00:59:15.817 --> 00:59:17.569
You don't have to give up
painting either.

00:59:17.766 --> 00:59:20.720
I have a plan.
I'll only take a few days.

00:59:28.065 --> 00:59:29.566
I'm your mother.

00:59:30.311 --> 00:59:33.061
Mothers can do anything.

00:59:33.684 --> 00:59:34.849
Trust me, okay?

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:55.392
400,000 WON PER 0.5G. HOW MUCH?

00:59:55.434 --> 00:59:56.434
100.

01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:22.606
James?

01:00:32.679 --> 01:00:34.942
What business does a cleaner
have with me?

01:00:36.292 --> 01:00:39.957
I can't wait forever.
Your time's up.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.434
Wait, hang on.

01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:56.426
When is James coming, anyway?

01:00:57.668 --> 01:01:00.809
He shows up when he wants,
sells, and leaves.

01:01:00.941 --> 01:01:04.730
None of his customers know
about him apart from his name.

01:01:04.777 --> 01:01:07.472
Really? What does he have to hide?

01:01:08.726 --> 01:01:09.892
300 million?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.225
In Gwangnam, everyone knows everyone.

01:01:13.355 --> 01:01:15.925
Then suddenly,
he appeared out of nowhere.

01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:18.300
Sounds fishy.
Can we trust him?

01:01:18.355 --> 01:01:21.809
Everyone was skeptical at first.

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:28.019
He'll get you weed, ketamine, meth...
Whatever you want.

01:01:28.043 --> 01:01:28.849
Hold on a sec.

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:32.332
Plus, he plans his transactions perfectly,
and has good manners.

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:35.849
I was wondering
what you were up to.

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:39.309
Lady, did you go around eavesdropping?

01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:44.517
Gwangnam is different from Hongdae
or Itaewon. If you're rich and stylish,

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:45.849
they don't care about your age.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:50.225
Many people are into older prostitutes.
Like guys in their fifties.

01:01:51.392 --> 01:01:52.320
What?

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:56.081
There are easier ways to earn money.
Why be a cleaner, right?

01:02:04.768 --> 01:02:06.849
What... are you doing?

01:02:07.476 --> 01:02:08.849
Aren't you going to show me?

01:02:11.927 --> 01:02:14.564
I need to check you out
before I connect you.

01:02:15.555 --> 01:02:17.097
Are you crazy?

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:21.350
Lady, stop pretending!

01:02:21.563 --> 01:02:24.355
Nothing's free in this world, right?

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:28.642
No, I'm serious!

01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:32.184
You fucking whore.

01:02:32.225 --> 01:02:33.642
Come here!

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.242
Can we do the transaction tomorrow?

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:39.975
No, security has tightened cuz of Phantom.
No shipments until next week.

01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:45.017
Crazy bitch!

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:55.601
Damn, do you have
a death wish or what?

01:02:55.849 --> 01:02:58.975
Bitch, how dare you slap me?

01:03:00.642 --> 01:03:01.849
Get up.

01:03:05.142 --> 01:03:06.642
You piss me off.

01:03:06.684 --> 01:03:07.849
Get up.

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:10.809
What a fucked up day.

01:03:11.073 --> 01:03:12.975
Bitch, you need more beating.

01:03:22.262 --> 01:03:24.387
- Wha..?
- What are you doing?

01:03:27.903 --> 01:03:29.111
I was just...

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.579
Payback?

01:03:36.186 --> 01:03:37.228
No, no.

01:03:45.248 --> 01:03:47.332
She hit me first.

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:51.100
How about we let a third party decide?

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:53.849
Like the cops, for example.

01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:56.726
Chill, why go that far?

01:03:56.768 --> 01:03:59.849
Exactly.
Why go that far, right?

01:04:00.941 --> 01:04:03.434
I told you not to cause trouble.

01:04:07.184 --> 01:04:09.059
You're banned from coming up here.

01:04:09.642 --> 01:04:11.059
Hand over the card key
and fuck off.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:13.975
Who do you think you are?

01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:23.348
Wanna find out?

01:04:50.332 --> 01:04:51.499
What is this?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:57.642
Yours?

01:05:03.768 --> 01:05:05.225
Is it gold or what?

01:05:05.726 --> 01:05:08.535
You can report his ass
for assault if you want.

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.726
No, I won't do that.

01:05:19.431 --> 01:05:20.848
If you change your mind...

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:24.091
Uh, wait.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:30.515
Thank... you.

01:05:43.434 --> 01:05:47.809
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

01:05:53.054 --> 01:05:56.185
Nor anyone who draws more curiosity.

01:06:06.532 --> 01:06:07.989
James!

01:06:15.692 --> 01:06:17.150
Are you down or not?

01:06:21.849 --> 01:06:24.476
I need it tomorrow.
At least 15g up front.

01:07:15.193 --> 01:07:16.277
Who are you, huh?

01:07:22.696 --> 01:07:24.849
Wait. The cleaning lady?

01:07:25.683 --> 01:07:26.973
What the hell?

01:07:29.118 --> 01:07:30.368
Why are you following me?

01:07:30.535 --> 01:07:32.743
Hey, are you listening?

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:40.549
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?

01:07:46.059 --> 01:07:48.115
Sua's mother?

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.662
No way.
What are you doing here?

01:07:51.678 --> 01:07:52.678
James.

01:07:58.309 --> 01:08:00.849
You're James, aren't you?

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:09.661
No, let me explain.

01:08:09.849 --> 01:08:12.848
A guy I know needed
some help at the club.

01:08:12.849 --> 01:08:13.849
Count me in.

01:08:14.592 --> 01:08:16.051
- What?
- Let's work together.

01:08:24.983 --> 01:08:27.982
Let's be partners.
You and me.

01:09:22.726 --> 01:09:25.642
WALKING ON THIN ICE

01:09:26.283 --> 01:09:28.673
The profit will be split
7:3 in favor of James.

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:29.970
Are you kidding me?

01:09:30.142 --> 01:09:32.447
I look forward to seeing
how valuable you become.

01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:34.085
I can sell it in no time.

01:09:34.085 --> 01:09:35.353
I'm curious.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.108
Hey, where did you lose
the drug bag again?

01:09:38.142 --> 01:09:40.335
It's identical to the one
from Kim Bongnam's motel room.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.309
James!

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.759
You think I don't know
they had a drug party here?

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:45.392
You look damn familiar.

01:09:45.434 --> 01:09:48.849
Have you forgotten that I caught you?

01:09:49.369 --> 01:09:51.345
Then should I tell Sua too?

01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:52.848
Fucking bastard...

01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:54.849
Did you expect
a drug dealer to be nice?
